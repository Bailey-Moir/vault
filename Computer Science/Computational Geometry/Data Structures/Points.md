A *point* is a position in space, represented with coordinates in a Cartesian grid (a [[Basic Python#Tuples|tuple]]).

> [!note]  *Points* and [[Computer Science/Computational Geometry/Data Structures/Vectors|vectors]] have the same representation.

> [!operations]- Given *points* $A$ and $B$,
> - **Subtraction**
>   $\vecbf{v} = B - A$
> - **Linear/[[Affine Cipher|Affine]] Sum**
>   $P(\alpha) = A + \alpha(B-A)$
