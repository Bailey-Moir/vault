A *convex hull* of a [[Sets|set]] of [[Points|points]] $S$ is a unique convex polygon that contains every point of $S$, and whose vertices are [[Points|points]] in $S$.

> [!definition]- A polygon is **convex** iff every interior angle is less than or equal to $180^\circ$.
> Note, any line segment connecting two interior points lies entirely within the polygon.
