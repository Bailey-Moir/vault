*Thermal noise* is the random changes in the channel, e.g. from sunlight or circuit components themselves. A standard model for *thermal noise* is **additive white Gaussian noise** (**AWGN**), in which the noise signal $n(t)$ is modelled as a zero-[[Mean|mean]] [[Normal Distributions|normally distributed]] (or [[Gaussian Distribution|guassian]]) [[Random Variables|random variable]] with [[Density Curve|probability density function]]
$$f(x) = \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$$
