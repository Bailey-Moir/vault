Analogue symbols belong to a continuum of possibilities, mapping a **continuous range of form** onto a **continuous range of meaning**. Digital symbols are **discrete** symbols. Digital messages are read not beheld. 

Purely digital messages can be copied without any loss of information. Minor errors in the form of symbols are irrelevant. Analogue messages will drift in meaning through repeated copying. 

While digital messages can travel intact through time, their meaning may
not. Numbers on road signs, for example, implicitly refer to kilometers, whereas some time ago they meant miles.
