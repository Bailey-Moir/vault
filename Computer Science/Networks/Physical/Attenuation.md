*Attenuation* refers to loss of signal power most often due for varying distance between transmitter and receiver. It is measured in the ratio between power at the transmitter and power at the receiver.
$$\eta = \dfrac{P_{tx}}{P_{rx}}.$$
These can be very large, so a logarithm scale (**decibels**) is often used
$$\eta_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}\eta.$$

> [!note] $\eta_{dB} = 10 \iff \eta = 10$

> [!important-note] Higher frequencies are attenuated more.
