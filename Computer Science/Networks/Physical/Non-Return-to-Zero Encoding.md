*Non-Return-to-Zero* (*NRZ*) *encoding* methods are methods of transmitting a signal over a cable where different symbols don't need to be broken up.

> [!note] The signal level needs to change sufficiently often, as otherwise the receiver may lose synchronisation, which is done with [[Manchester Encoding|Manchester encoding]] in things like [[TCP-IP Reference Model|Ethernet]] instead of *NRZ*.
