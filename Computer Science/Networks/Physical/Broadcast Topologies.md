In *broadcast topologies*, [[Stations|stations]] perform [[Passband Transmission|passband transmission]] in **half-duplex mode**, meaning [[Medium Access Control|MAC]] is needed, using [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access#CSMA / CD|CSMA/CD]].

> [!note] This is only used in $10 \text{ Mbps}$ PHYs (the bottom end of [[Ethernet|Ethernet]]).

> [!definition] A [[Stations|station]] in **half-duplex mode** switches between transmitting and receiving (but never both at the same time).
