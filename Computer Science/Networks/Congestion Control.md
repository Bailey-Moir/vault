*Congestion control* schemes try to avoid congestion or deal with it optimally, e.g.
- Subject packet flows to admission control (like triage).
- Sending signals to traffic sources to reduce data rates (pls send less).
- Modify pricing during congestion.

> [!definition] In [[Packet-Switching|packet-switching]], **congestion** is when a [[Routers|router]]'s memory is full, meaning packets must be dropped.
