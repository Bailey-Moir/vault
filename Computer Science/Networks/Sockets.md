![300|center](sockets.excalidraw)
A *socket* is bound to a [[Ports|port]]. The main types of *socket* are
- `socket()`: create a socket, allocating resources (e.g. buffer) and assigning a random unused port.
- `bind()`: bind socket to a particular port.
- `listen()`: Declare willingness to accept incoming connections, and allocate resources (queue).
- `accept()`: Accept an incoming connection from the queue, and create a new *socket* for it, bound to the same [[Ports|port]] `listen()` was called on ( #TODO how tf does that work ).
- `connect()`: establish connection with [[Client-Server Paradigm|server]] (similar to [[Circuit-Switching|circuit-switching]]), or for [[#Datagram Sockets|datagram sockets]], specifies a default receiver.
- `recv()`/`send()`: reading/writing to/from the socket buffers.
- `close()`: close connection.
