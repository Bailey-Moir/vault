*Classless inter-domain routing* (*CIDR*) allows you to vary how many of 32 bits are allocated to the [[Networks|network]] address and the [[Hosts|host]] address respectively using a **netmask**.

#cheatsheet special addresses

> [!note]- Special [[Hosts|host]] addresses
> In the [[Networks|network]] $a.b.c.d/k$, there are two special [[Hosts|host]] addresses:
> - All $0$s gives to the [[Networks|network]] address as a whole.
> - All $1$s gives the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] address for the [[Networks|network]].
