In *orthogonal [[Medium Access Control|MAC]] schemes*, the behaviour of one station does not influence the behaviour/[[Throughput|throughput]]/transmission success of other stations. The four main (mostly) *orthogonal schemes* are:
- [[Frequency Division Multiple Access|FDMA]],
- [[Time Division Multiple Access|TDMA]],
- SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access), and
- CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).
