*Interior routing protocols* are used within an [[Autonomous Systems|AS]], and *exterior routing protocols* are used between [[Autonomous Systems|AS]]s.

> [!note] *Interior* $=$ Intra-, *Exterior* $=$ Inter-

> [!note] If an [[Autonomous Systems|AS]] has multiple links to other [[Autonomous Systems|AS]]s, the [[Routers|routers]] on these links will obtain the reachability information from neighbouring [[Autonomous Systems|AS]]s using an *exterior protocol*, and [[Routing Protocols|flood]] this information to all [[Routers|routers]] in its [[Autonomous Systems|AS]].
