An *autonomous system* (*AS*) is a [[Sets|set]] of [[Routers|routers]] and [[Networks|networks]] managed by a **single organisation**, typically all using a common [[Routing Protocols|routing protocol]]. Each *AS* is assigned an **autonomous system number** (**ASN**).

> [!example] Typically each [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] is an *AS*, but other good examples are corporations and universities.

*AS*s are categorised by the way they are connected:
- **Stub *AS*s** are only connected to one other *AS*.
- **Multi-homed *AS*s** are connected to multiple *AS*s, but doesn't allow traffic to pass through.
- **Transit *AS*s** are connected to multiple *AS*s, and allows traffic to pass through.
