The *bandwidth* of a [[Networks|network]] is the bits per second it can **actually** transfer (accounting for [[Latency|latency]], [[Bandwidth|bandwidth]], lost [[Packets|packets]], etc.).

> [!definition] The **instantaneous** *throughput* gives the *throughput* over a very short period of time, whereas the **average** *throughput* gives the *throughput* over a longer period of time.
