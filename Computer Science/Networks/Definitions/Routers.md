A *router* (and *switches*) are used to connect [[Networks|networks]] together.

They receive [[Packets|packets]] and use their addressing fields to find the right outgoing link to send it through, and thus a path to the destination (*routing*).

> [!note] A *router* is called a *router* for [[Packet-Switching|packet-switching]], and a *switch* for [[Circuit-Switching|circuit switching]].
