Each [[Hosts|host]] is identified by one or more *IP* (*internet protocol*) addresses (as many *IP*s as it has [[Networks|network]] adaptors (???), but normally only one).

The *IP* address helps to identify the [[Hosts|host]], but also helps [[Routers|routers]] to find the path to the [[Hosts|host]] through the [[Networks|network]].

*IP* provides [[Packets|packet]] delivery, which is:
- Connectionless (not [[Circuit-Switching|circuit-switching]])
- Unacknowledged (no success, fail response or anything)
- Unreliable (no retransmissions)
- Unordered
