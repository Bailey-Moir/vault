We look at 4 types of *reliable data transfer* (*RDT*) protocols:
- **rdt 1.0**: over a perfectly reliable channel.
- **rdt 2.0**: over a channel with bit errors ([[Automatic Repeat reQuest#Go-back-N]]).
- **rdt 3.0**: over a [[Lossless v. Lossy|lossy]] channel with bit errors ([[Alternating Bit Protocols]]).
- pipelined reliable data transfer protocols ([[Automatic Repeat reQuest#Go-back-N]] & [[Automatic Repeat reQuest#Selective Repeat/Reject (SR)]]).
