![500|center](cpu.excalidraw)
The *central processing unit* (*CPU*) gives the computer the ability to perform various operations on various operands.  Comprises of the [[ALU|ALU]], [[General Purpose Registers|general purpose registers]], [[Control Registers|control registers]], and the [[Control-Execute Unit|control/execute unit]].

> [!note] These [[Registers|registers]] must be so close to the [[ALU|ALU]], as it is performing operations very fast, so it needs to be able to receive information very fast ($v=\frac{d}{t}$).
