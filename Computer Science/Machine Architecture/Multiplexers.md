A *multiplexer* (*mux*) selects which input(s) gets outputted. 
![300|center](multiplexer.excalidraw)
> [!note] For a single output *multiplexer*, a [[Encoders and Decoders|decoder]] is used on $S$ and the resutlts are [[and-logic-gate.excalidraw|AND]]ed with their respective inputs.

> [!Note] *Multiplexers* with multiple outputs are equivalent to multiple single output *multiplexers*.
