A *multiplexer* (*demux*) selects which output passes the input.
![300|center](demultiplexer.excalidraw)


> [!note] A single input *demultiplexer* gives the output of a [[Encoders and Decoders|decoder]] on $S$ [[and-logic-gate.excalidraw|AND]]ed with the input.

> [!Note] *Demultiplexers* with multiple outputs are equivalent to multiple single output *demultiplexers*.
