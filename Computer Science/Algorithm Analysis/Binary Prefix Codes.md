A *binary prefix code* is represented using a [[Binary Trees|binary tree]], where each [[Leaf Nodes|leaf node]] represents a character.
> [!example] `a` $= 00$, `c` $= 1$

> [!theorem]- A *binary code* is [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] iff no binary string in the code is a prefix of another.
>  In this case, [[Ambiguity|ambiguity]] corresponds to multiple interpretations of the same code.
