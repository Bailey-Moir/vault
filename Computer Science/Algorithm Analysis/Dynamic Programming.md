*Dynamic programming* is a design method that can be used to solve optimisation problems in which the solution to a problem can be expressed in terms of solutions to a set of overlapping subproblems (i.e., a [[Recursion|recursive]] formulation).

> [!definition] Top-down *DP*
> Expressing solutions [[Recursion|recursively]] (starting with the original problem) using [[Memoisation|memoisation]].

> [!definition] Bottom-up *DP*
> Using [[Recursion|recursion]] to solve all possible sub-problems, starting from the simplest.
