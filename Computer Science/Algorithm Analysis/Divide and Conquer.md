*Divide and Conquer* (*D&C*) is an algorithm design technique.
1. **Divide** the problem into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. **Conquer** the problems by solving them [[Recursion|recursively]]
3. **Combine** the solutions of the sub-problems into a solution for the original problem.

> [!example] [[Merge Sort]] is a *D&C* [[Algorithms|algorithm]].
