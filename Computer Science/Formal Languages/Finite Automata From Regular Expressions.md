Every [[Languages of Regular Expressions|language generated by a regular expression]] is accepted by an [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]].
- The resulting [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]] has exactly one accept state (which is not the start state), and no transitions into the start state or out of the accept state.

# Examples
> [!note] $[p]$ can be replaced directly with $p|\varepsilon$.

> [!note]  $\overline{p}$ can be found by complementing the [[Deterministic Finite Automata|DFA]] for $p$.

> [!note]  $\Large\; \varepsilon$
