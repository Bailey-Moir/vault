Consider **generalised [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]]**:
- Transitions may be labelled with [[Regular Languages|regular expressions]].
- There is exactly one accept state.
- There is at most one transition between any two states.
- There are no transitions into the start state or out of the accept state.

Every [[Languages|language]] accepted by an [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]] is generated by a [[Regular Expressions|regular expression]]. This can be done by removing states between the start and accept state using the following rule.

Once all that remains is the start and final state, the resulting transition regular expression is equivalent to the **generalised [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]]**.
