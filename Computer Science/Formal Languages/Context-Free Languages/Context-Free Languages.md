The *language generated* by the [[Context-Free Grammars|CFG]] $G = \left( N,\Sigma,P,S \right)$, $L(G)$, is its **sentences**. That [[Languages|language]] is then said to be **context-free**.

> [!note]- The set of [[Languages|languages]] generated by all [[Context-Free Grammars|CFGs]] is equal to the set of [[Languages|languages]] generated by all [[Pushdown Automata|PDAs]].

> The idea is to simulate [[Ambiguity|leftmost]]-[[Derivability|derivations]], keeping track of [[Context-Free Grammars|sentential forms]].

> Then $A \Rightarrow^* xz$ is a [[Ambiguity|left-most]]-[[Derivability|derivation]] iff $\left( q_{1},xy,A \right) \to^* \left( q_{1},y,z \right)$.
# Closure
> [!proof]- [[Unions and Intersections|Union]]
> Let $L_{1} = L(( N_{1}, \Sigma, P_{1}, S_{1} ))$ and $L_{2} = L(( N_{2}, \Sigma, P_{2}, S_{2} ))$, where $N_{1} \cap N_{2} = \emptyset$.

> Construct $G = \left( N_{1} \cup N_{2} \cup \{ S \}, \Sigma, P_{1} \cup P_{2} \cup \{ S \to S_{1}, S \to S_{2} \}, S \right)$, where $S \notin N_{1} \cup N_{2}$.

> Then $L(G) = L_{1} \cup L_{2}$.

> [!proof]- **NOT** [[Unions and Intersections|Intersection]]
> $L_{1} = \{ a^kb^nc^n : k, n \in \N \}$ and $L_{2} = \{ a^nb^nc^k : k,n \in \N \}$ are *context-free*, but $L_{1}\cap L_{2} = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n \in N \}$ is **not** *context-free*.

> [!proof]- **NOT** [[Complement|Complement]]
> It is closed under [[Unit Vectors|union]], so by [[De Morgan's Laws|De Morgan's laws]], if it was closed under [[Complement|complement]], it would have to be closed under [[Unions and Intersections|intersectionn]] (which it is not).
