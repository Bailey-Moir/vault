- A [[Context-Free Languages|sentence]] is *ambiguous* iff it has more than one **leftmost** [[Derivability|derivation]].
- A [[Context-Free Grammars|CFG]] is *ambiguous* iff it generates an *ambiguous [[Context-Free Languages|sentence]]*.
- A [[Context-Free Languages|CFL]] is **inherently** *ambiguous* iff every [[Context-Free Grammars|CFG]] generating it is *ambiguous*.

> [!definition] A **leftmost** [[Derivability|derivation]] is a [[Derivability|derivation]] done by only [[Context-Free Grammars|producing]] on the leftmost non-terminal.
