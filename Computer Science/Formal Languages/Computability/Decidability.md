A [[Languages|langauge]] $L$ is *decidable* (computable), if there is an [[Algorithms|algorithm]] that, for every input $w$, outputs `True` if $w \in L$ and outputs `False` if $w \notin L$.

A [[Functions|function]] $f : A \to B$ is *computable* iff there is an [[Algorithms|algorithm]] that outputs $f(x)$ for each $x \in A$.

A [[Functions|function]] $f : \Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$ is *computable* iff $f = F(M)$ for some [[Turing Machines|total]] [[Turing Machines|TM]] $M$.
