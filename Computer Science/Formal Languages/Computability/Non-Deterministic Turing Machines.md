A *non-deterministic Turing machine* (*NTM*) is like a [[Turing Machines|TM]], except
- the [[Codomain|codomain]] of $\delta$ in a *NTM* is the [[Power Sets|power set]] of the [[Codomain|codomain]] of $\delta$ in a [[Turing Machines|TM]], as $\delta$ maps to a [[Sets|sets]] of possibilities (including [[Empty Set|empty sets]]).

> [!note] the similarities between *NTM*s and [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]]s.

> [!theorem] *NTM*s and [[Turing Machines|TM]]s accept the same [[Languages|languages]], but [[Turing Machines|TM]]s might be slower.
