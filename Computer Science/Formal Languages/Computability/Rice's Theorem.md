Let $S$ be a [[Sets|set]] of [[Languages|languages]] over $\Sigma$. Assume that $L(M_{0}) \notin S$ and $L(M_{1}) \in S$ for some [[Turing Machines|TM]]s $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$. Then
$$\{ \left< M \right> : L(M) \in S \}$$
is [[Decidability|undecidable]].

> [!alternative definition] Suppose there is a [[Sets|set]] of [[Languages|languages]] with [[Turing Machines|TM]]s whose [[Languages|languages]] inside and outside of it.Then, deciding if a given [[Turing Machines|TM]]'s [[Languages|language]] is in the [[Sets|set]] is [[Decidability|undecidable]].
