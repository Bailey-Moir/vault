The *language generated* by the [[Context-Free Grammar|CFG]] $G = \left( N,\Sigma,P,S \right)$, $L(G)$, is its **sentences**. That [[Languages|language]] is then said to be **context-free**.

> [!definition] The [[Sets|set]] of **sentential forms** of $G$ is $$\left\{ x \in (N \cup \Sigma)^* : S \Rightarrow_{G}^* x \right\} $$[^1]
