*Semantic analysis* is the third step of [[Compilers|compiling]]. In this stage, the abstract syntax tree generated by the [[Syntax Analysis|parser]] is taken, annotating nodes with information about the program.

> [!examples]
> - **Type Checking**
>   Are functions applied to arguments of matching type?
> - **Type Inference**
>   What is the type of an expression
> - **Declaration**
>   Is every variable declared exactly once
> - **Definite Assignment**
>   Is a variable assigned before it is used.
> - **Binding**
>   To which declaration does the use of a variable belong ( #TODO what?).

> [!definition] **Static semantics** are those aspects that can be checked at compile-time.
