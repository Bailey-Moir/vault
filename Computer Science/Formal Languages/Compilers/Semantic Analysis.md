- **type checking**
  are functions applied to arguments of matching type?
- **type inference**
  what is the type of an expression?
- **declaration**
  is every variable declared exactly once?
- **definite assignment**
  is a variable assigned before it is used?
- **binding**
  to which declaration does the use of a variable belong?
