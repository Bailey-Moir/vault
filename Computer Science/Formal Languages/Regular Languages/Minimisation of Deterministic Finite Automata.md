To *minimise* the number of states of a [[Deterministic Finite Automata|DFA]],
1. Eliminate states which cannot be reached from the start state.
2. Find [[Equivalence of States|equivalent states]].
3. Merge [[Equivalence Classes|equivalence classes]] of states.

> [!note] *Minimal DFAs* are unique up to [[Isomorphisms|isomorphism]]
