An *ordered linked list* is a [[Linked Lists|linked list]] that is always ordered. The structure is the same, but the methods/functions that manipulate it are different.
- The `add` method is now $\mathcal{O}(n)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, as it must search for the position in the sequence to insert the new node.
