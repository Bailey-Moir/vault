A *tree* can be implemented either as a [[Basic Python#Lists|list of lists]] or with nodes and references. I will focus on the latter. With this implementation, the only difference between a *tree* and a [[Linked Lists|linked list]] is a *tree* has multiple pointers/references in each [[Vertices|vertex]].
