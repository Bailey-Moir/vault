[[Trees|Trees]] can be represented by a [[Functions|function]] for [[Edges|edges]] from [[Parent, Children, and Sibling Nodes|children vertices]] to [[Parent, Children, and Sibling Nodes|parents vertices]]. This can be represented as a *list/array* where the index represents the [[Parent, Children, and Sibling Nodes|child vertex]], and the value represents the [[Parent Arrays|parent vertex]].
