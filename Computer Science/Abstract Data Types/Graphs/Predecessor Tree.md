A *predecessor [[Trees|tree]]* is generated during a [[Graph Traversal|graph traversal]].
- The starting [[Vertices|vertex]] becomes the [[Root|root]].
- When [[Graph Traversal|undiscovered]] [[Vertices|vertices]] encountered, they are made [[Parent, Children, and Sibling Nodes|children]] of the previous [[Vertices|vertex]].
- [[Edges|Edges]] that appear in the *predecessor [[Trees|tree]]* are called **tree edges**.

This [[Trees|tree]] can be represented using a [[Parent Arrays|parent array]].
