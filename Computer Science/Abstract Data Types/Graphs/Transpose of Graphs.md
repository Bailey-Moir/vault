The *[[Math/Linear Algebra/Matrices/Transposition|tranpose]]/reverse of a [[Graphs|graph]]* $G = (V,E)$ is $G^T = (V,E^T)$ where.
$$(u,v) \in E \iff (v,u) \in E^T$$
> [!note] The [[Adjacency Matrices|adjacency matrix]] of a *transposed graph* is [[Math/Linear Algebra/Matrices/Transposition|tranposed]].
