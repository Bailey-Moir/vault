In an *adjacency [[Matrices|matrix]]*, each entry $a_{ij}$ gives the [[Weighted Graphs|weighting]] of the [[Edges|edge]] from [[Vertices|vertices]] $i$ to $j$. 
- [[Directed Graphs|Undirected graphs]] have [[Symmetric Matrices|symmetric]] *adjacency matrices*.
- Entries for [[Weighted Graphs|unweighted graphs]] instead indicate [[Edges|adjacency/incidence]].
- There are no [[Loops|loops]] iff the main diagonal is $0$.
