A *min/max heap* is an implementation of a [[Priority Queues|priority queue]] in the form of a [[Implementing Trees|tree]] such that [[Vertices|vertices']] keys are *smaller/larger* than (or equal to) the keys of their [[Parent, Children, and Sibling Nodes|children]]. Therefore, the *min/max* of a *min/max heap* is the [[Root|root]].
