Specific technologies don't matter in University, it's about the skills.
Venture-??? companies aren't as susceptible to the cycles of the technology industry.
??? = capital ?
# Companies
Partly is a startup, focus is obviously not. Very different mindsets. Focus gives a lot of flexibility. Every 10th day you have a personal development day. Partly you have a lot more responsibility, what you do matters so you don't have as much flexibility.

# PhDs
- Pick a good supervisor.
- [[#Work-Life Balance]] fluctuates a lot.
# Work-Life Balance
<center>employee vs startup vs founder</center>
Work can overlap with life sometimes, and that's okay (to a point). If you are passionate you generally will put in more hours, which is what you want in life (student job mindset will not be helpful). If you have equity (startup), then you are often motivated to work more to benefit the company.

# AI
I think this is obvious, but AI is not taking over for a while.
# Hiring Process
- Describe a project (on GitHub or live website) that is interesting or looks difficult.
- Door-knocking is actually good apparently (according to founder and another person).
- Soft-skills are important (analysis, resilience, teamwork, communication, etc) so
	- Do group projects (they can be really hard but it is very important) (302).
	- Do extra-curriculars.
- Make a company (again, really hard).
- Do personal projects.
