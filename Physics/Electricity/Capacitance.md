The *capacitance* of a component/circuit measures its ability to collect and store energy as [[Charge|electrical charge]]. 
$$ C = \dfrac{Q}{V} $$
> [!variables]-
> - $C$ is the *capacitance* ($F$) of the component/circuit.
> - $Q$ is the stored [[Charge|charge]] ($C$) in the component/circuit.
> - $V$ is the [[Voltage|voltage]] ($V$) across the component/circuit.

# Total Capacitance
- **[[Parallel and Series Circuits|Series]] Equation**
  $\dfrac{1}{C_{T}} = \dfrac{1}{C_{1}} + \dfrac{1}{C_{2}} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{C_{n}}$
- **[[Parallel and Series Circuits|Parallel]] Equation**
  $C_{T} = C_{1} + C_{2} + \dots + C_{n}$
