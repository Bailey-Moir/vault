$$ V_{0} = \varepsilon - Ir $$
*Electromotive force*, denoted $\varepsilon$, is the constant electrical potential ([[Voltage|voltage]]) given by a [[Battery|battery]], and the theoretical maximum [[Voltage|voltage]].
- Since *electromotive force* is constant, it is present without [[Current|current]].
