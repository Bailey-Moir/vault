*Magnetic flux* measures the total [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] which passes through a given area.
$$\phi=BA\sin\theta$$

> - $\phi$ is *magnetic flux* ($Wb$).
> - $B$ is the strength of the [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] ($T$).
> - $A$ is the area ($m^{2}$ #TODO wtf).
> - $\theta$ is the angle of the [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] ( #TODO wtf v2 ).
