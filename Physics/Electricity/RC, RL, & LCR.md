*RC* and *RL* circuits are [[Alternating Current|AC]] with a [[Resistor|resistor]], and a [[Capacitors|capacitor]] and [[Inductors|inductor]] respectively, with *LCR* circuits containing both.

In *RC* circuits, since the [[Current|current]] is always changing direction, the [[Polarity|polarity]] of the capacitor(s) changes.

# Reactance & Resonance
$$\begin{array}{c}
	X_{L} = \omega L \\
	X_{C} = \dfrac{1}{\omega C} \\
\end{array}$$
In *LCR* circuits, when $X_{L}=X_{C}$, [[Current|current]] is maximum as impedence ($z$) is minimum. Note impedance is [[Physics/Electricity/Resistance|resistance]] in *LCR* circuits.
