When waves are [[Diffraction|diffracted]] by two slits in an opaque barrier, the waves [[Interference|interfere]]. If these are light waves shone onto a parallel screen/plane,
- The **central maxima** is the central band. It has the properties of being the brightest (having the greatest amplitude), and having a path difference of 0.
- As the distance from the **central maxima** increases, the brightness decreases.
- [[Interference|Antinodes]] occur when path difference is $0$ [[Congruence|modulo]] $\lambda$, whereas [[Interference|nodes]] occur when the path difference is $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ [[Congruence|modulo]] $\lambda$.

If the distance to the screen from the source $L$ is much greater than the distance from the **central maxima** to the given point of interference $x$, the angle $\theta$ will be very small, meaning $\sin\theta \approx \tan \theta$.
$$n\lambda=d\sin\theta \approx \frac{dx}{L}$$
where $d$ is the distance between the two slits.
