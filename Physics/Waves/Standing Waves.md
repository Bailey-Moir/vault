*Standing waves* occur when two waves of the same amplitude and frequency travelling in opposite directions [[Interference|interfere]]. Nodes are found at closed ends, and antinodes are found at open ends.
$$f_n = nf_1$$
> [!note]- Closed at both ends

$$\lambda = 2L$$

> [!note]- Open at both ends

$$\lambda = 2L$$

> [!note]- Open at one

$$\lambda = 4L$$
