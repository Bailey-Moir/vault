*Beats* occur when two waves that have a **slightly differing frequencies** are heard at the same time. [[Interference]] between them produces a **fluctuating amplitude** that is heard as pulsating volume with a frequency equal to the difference in frequency between the two waves.
$$f_{\text{beat}}=\left| f_{1}-f_{2} \right| $$
