Suppose you have a set [[Sets|set]] $S$ of $n$ elements, where each element in $S$ has a positive value $b_{i}$, and a positive weight $w_{i}$.
Determine the [[Subsets|subset]] of $S$ that yields the maximum value without exceeding a given weight $W$.
This is *fractional* as a fraction of each item can be taken.
