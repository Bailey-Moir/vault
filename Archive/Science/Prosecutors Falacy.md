The mistake of mistaking the posterior probability with the conditional probability. Getting from one to the other can be done using [[Bayes' Theorem|Baye's rule]].

| Name                    | Equation       |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Prior Probability       | P($H_1$)       |
| Posterior Probability   | $P(H \vert E)$ |
| Conditional Probability | $P(E \vert H)$ |
\[[[Conditional Probability]]\]
