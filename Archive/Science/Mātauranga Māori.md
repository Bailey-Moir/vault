A recent term relating to knowledge coined to articulate how Māori looked at the work pre-colonization.
Knowledge as a 'thing' is not a traditional Māori concept.
Initially differentiated from the new knowledge of Pākehā.

$$\text{Mātauranga} = \text{Knowledge brought by Pākehā: biblical knowledge}$$
