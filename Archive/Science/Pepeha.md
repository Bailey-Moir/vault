To be delivered with respect and humility, and typically is received with respect and gratification, effort rather than perfection
# Traditionally
A statement of collective identity. Used to acknowledge a tribe including the land and people. it was an introduction from a communal perspective.

# Today
A pepeha is a method of introduction to make connections with an audience, and includes placing oneself in time & space in relation to **whenua** (land) and **wh훮nau** (people)
- For M훮ori, a traditional format may be applicable, for non-M훮ori, there are multiple ways of adapting the format.
- The primary goal is to retain the principle that it is about making connections, it is contextual
- The pepeha may form part of a mihimihi or is sometimes presented on its own

## Whenua (land)
First, we place ourselves in the context of our ancestral whenua (land), where di our ancestors come from? What were the environmental features that nourished them? Moutain or hill? River, lake, sea or ocean? Land?

## Wh훮nau (family, people)
Second, we acknowledge our family lineage, who we belong to. May include our clan, church, university, wide and/or nuclear family (in order of saying).
## Where we are today
Third, we share out present, where we live now. We may or may not include our partner, children, pet and/or occupation.
## Always place ourselves last
- Finally, we share our name. Where we come from and who we represent is given precedence, and our mana is derived from them.
