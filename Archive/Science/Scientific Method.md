Suggestion #1: Scientists are proving theories about the world
---
# Underdetermination of Theory by Evidence
- The evidence **fails to determine** which theory is true.
- It is always consistent with lots of different theories being true.


Suggestion #2: Scientists are proving theories false about the world
---
-Carl Popper
- Scientists should aim to **falsify** their hypotheses.
# The Demarcation Problem
- A **pseudoscience** is sham or pretend science.
- A set of beliefs or ideas count as being pseudoscientific if they are promoted as being scientific when they are in fact unscientific.
- Some plausible examples of psuedosciences:
	- Astrology
	- Creation Science / Integlligent Design
	- Homeopathy
- The demarcation problem is the problem of drawing a line between science and non-science.
- A principled answer to this question would supply us with a demarcation criterion.

## Carl Popper's Solution
Carl Popper says that the difference between science and pseudoscience is science makes risky predictions, but pseudoscience plays it safe; they can't 'lose'; they don't rule anything out. They can explain anything, therefore, they really explain nothing.
- The criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.
- Science is the process of conjecture and refutation.

Therefore, pseudoscience is unfalsifiable, or it is still endorsed despite having been falsified.

# Deductive vs Inductive Reasoning
Deductive reasoning proves things. Inductive reasoning is about probability. Science is about inductive reasoning.
