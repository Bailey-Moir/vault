- *Kai* (the agent) *tiaki* (to preserve, guard, protect)
- A kaitiaki is an agent of protection, active rather than passive care.
- Whenua and the natural environment is our kaitiaki, the duty of humanity is to empower that care.
- ***Kaitiakitanga*** is looking after creation so it is able to function as intended.
- "I therefore contend that *kaitiakitanga* is a role that is more than just on-the-ground management. Rather, it encompasses a large spiritual element, and reflects the intergenerational approach taken by Māori to resource management." (Racheal Harris, Ngāi Tahu, 2015)
- *Tuakana* (older sibling) - *teina* (younger sibling) : responsibility of care, *kaitiakitanga*.
