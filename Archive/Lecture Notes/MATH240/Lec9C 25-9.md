For the rest of this section, we will assume $f$ and $g$ are [[Bounded Sets|bounded]] [[Functions|functions]] on a [[Intervals|closed interval]] $J=\left[ a,b \right]$, and that $g$ is [[Increasing and Decreasing Functions|monotonically increasing]] on $J$, although I've tried my best to make this explicit in my notes.
