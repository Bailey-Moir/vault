# Screen Essentialism
Screen essentialism is the tendency for people to think of the system as only the interface in front of them (the interface is the system). This course is largely about going beyond that.

## Input
e.g. keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, audio, camera, etc, touchpad, gyro-sensors, light sensors, joystick, location.

## Output
e.g. screen, speaker, headphones, haptic feedback, light (e.g. capslock, backlight), motors, printer, etc.

## Digital Objects
Something that's rendered by software.

## Materiality
Encoded information on digital media (could be on a disk, network).


# Color
## Pixels

## Colour Assimilation
Connecting the colour towards its neighbors.

## Colour Constancy
If you shine a green light on a red strawberry, but your brain knows that it should be red, so you see it as red.

The dress has an ill-defined light source, so if you assume the light is behind the dress, you will assume the light is a darker colour, but if you assume it's the front, you will assume it is a brighter colour.
