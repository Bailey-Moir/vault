# Ethical Theories
# Consequentialism
Assess moral choices by their consequences, becoming utilitarianism when taken to the extreme.
# Deontology
Determine that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules or principles rather than the consequence of that action.
# Relativism
The theory that holds that morality is relative to the norms of one's culture. That is, whether an action is right or wrong depends on the moral norms of the society in which it is practiced.
