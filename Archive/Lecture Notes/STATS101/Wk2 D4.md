# Standard Deviation
Measures the spread of a quantitative variable; simply how different things are on average (from the average).
$$\begin{align*}
	\text{standard deviation} &= \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum(x-\overline{x})^2}{n-1}} \\
	&= \dfrac{\left| \sum(x-\overline{x}) \right|}{\sqrt{n-1}} \\
\end{align*}$$
This gives a rough estimate of the typical distance of a data value from the mean.
Sample STD = $s$
Population STD = $\sigma$

Standard deviation is not resistant
# The 95% Rule (of Thumb)
If a distribution is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, about 95% of the data should fall within two standard deviations of the mean
$$\begin{align*}
	P(-1 < z < 1) &\approx 0.68 \\
	P(-2 < z < 2) &\approx 0.95 \\
	P(-3< z < 3) &\approx 0.997 \\
\end{align*}$$
# z-score
The number of standard deviations a given value is above or below the mean; how different something is.
$$ z = \dfrac{x - \overline{x}}{s} $$
# Percentile
The $P$-th percentile is the value of a quantitative variable which is greater than $P$ percent of the data.
$$ P\text{-th percentile} = \text{value of } Pn\text{-th entry} $$

# Five Number Summary
Used to describe key features of a distribution
- Minimum: smallest value
- First Quartile $Q_1$: 25th percentile
- Median: middle value (50th percentile)
- Third Quartile $Q_3$: 75th percentile
- Maximum: greatest value

## Range
$$ \text{range} = \text{max} - \text{min} $$
Range is not resistant
Note: range **is not** interval.
# Interquartile Range (IQR)
$$ \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1$$
IQR is resistant
