# Descriptive Statistics
> Summarizing and visualizing variables is often called *descriptive statistics* (or *exploratory data analysis*) 

# Frequency Tables
Shows the number of cases that fall in each category.

## Relative Frequency Table
The same as a frequency table, except instead of the number of cases, it is the [[#Proportion|proportion]] of the cases.
All the proportions in a relative frequency table sum to 1.
# Proportion
$$ \text{proportion} = \dfrac{\text{number in that category}}{\text{total number}} $$
Population: $p$
Sample proportion: $\hat{p}$

# Cumulative Counts
If the categorical variable is logical/ordinal, then a *cumulative count* is the number of cases at or below a certain level.

# Bar Charts
Displays a categorical variable, where the height corresponds to the number of cases.

# Pie Charts
Displays a categorical variable where the relative area of each slice of the pie corresponds to the proportion in each category.
We prefer not to use these as pie charts are hard to compare.
