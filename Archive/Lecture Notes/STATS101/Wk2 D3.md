# Side-by-Side / Clustered Bar Chart
Each bar represents one combination of the categorical variables. 

# Segmented/Stacked Bar Chart
The bars are stacked on top of each other.

## 100% Stacked bar
Uses relative frequencies (all bars have the total same height).

One Quantitative Variable
- The general **shape** of the data
- Where the data values are **centered**
- How the data **varies**.

# Shape
A distribution is called **symmetric** if the two sides are approximately matched when flipped across a vertical center line.

A distribution is called skewed to the right if it is piled up on the left and the tail extends relatively far out right, and vice versa.
# Bell-Shaped
Symmetric and shaped like a bell.

# Histograms
$$ \text{number of bins} = \dfrac{\text{max}-\text{min}}{n} \ni n = 2 \times \text{IQR} \times {n^{-\dfrac{1}{3}}} $$

# Mean/Average
$$\text{mean} = \dfrac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} = \dfrac{\Sigma x}{n} $$
Sample mean = $\overline{x}$
Population mean = $\mu$

# Median
> The middle value when the data is ordered

Denoted $m$, is a good measure when things are skewed (as mean is often a poor representation when a distribution is skewed).

# Outliers
An observed value that is notably distinct from the other values in a dataset.

# Resistance
How easily a statistics is affected by extreme values
Median is resistant while the mean is not.
