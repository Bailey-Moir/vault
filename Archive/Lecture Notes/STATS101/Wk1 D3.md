# Sampling Bias
A **sampling bias** occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to differ from the population in some relevant way. Sampling bias leads to samples that aren't representative of the population.

# Simple Random Sample
In a **simple random sample**, each unit of the population has the same chance of being selected, regardless of the other units chosen for the sample.

# Response and Non-response Bias
> **Response Bias**
> A systematic favoring of certain outcomes that occur when individuals **do not respond truthfully**.

> **Non-Response Bias**
> A systematic favoring of certain outcomes that occur when individuals who **choose to participate** in a study differ from those who chose not to participate.
