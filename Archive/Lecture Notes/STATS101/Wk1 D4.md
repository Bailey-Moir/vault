# Experimental and Observational Studies
> **Observational Study**
> A study which **does not control** any variable, but simply measures the values as they naturally exist.

> **Experiment**
> A study which **actively controls** the level of one or more of the explanatory variables.

Experimental studies can imply a causal relationship, whereas observational studies can only imply an association as observational studies almost always have [[#Spurious Correlation and Confounding Variables|confounding variables]].
# Association and Causation
$$ \text{Assocation} \hspace{.5em}\not{\hspace{-1em}\implies} \text{Causation} $$
> **Association**
> Two variables are *associated* if values of one variable tend to be related to the values of the other variable.

> **Causation**
> Two variables are *causally associated* if changing the value of one variable influences the value of the other variable. 

## Spurious Correlation and Confounding Variables

> **Spurious Correlation**
> Association but not causation, due to either coincidence or a **confounding variable**
