Row reductions don't affect [[Linear Independence|linear independence]]. Once in [[EF & REF|REF]], columns with [[Pivots and Free Variables|pivots]] are [[Vector Bases|basis vectors]] of the [[Span|span]] of the columns, whilst the columns with [[Pivots and Free Variables|free variables]] are [[Linear Combinations|linear combinations]] of the others.
