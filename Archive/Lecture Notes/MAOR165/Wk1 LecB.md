# Assimilation
The process of absorbing a people into a dominant culture in society. The goal is for the culture to no longer exist in any distinguishable form. Examples being cultural, linguistic, and religious assimilation.

Examples of policies and approaches:
- Religious converstion
- Removal of children
- Division of land and resources
- Gender roles

# Eugenics
Quickly went from encouraging desirable traits to discouraging undesirable traits:
> "It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind."
> Buck v. Bell, 1927.

> “It has rightly been decided that New Zealand should not only be a white man’s country, but as completely British as possible. We ought to make every effort to keep the stock sturdy and strong, as well as racially pure.” ​
> (Committee of Enquiry into Mental Defectiveness and Sexual Offenders, tasked with incarcerating “miscreants” 1925, quoted in Belich, p. 175). ​
