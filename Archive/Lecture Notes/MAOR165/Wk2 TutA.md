## Draft
> I am Bailey Moir. I am once a son, thrice a brother, and a student. In 2014, I lost my father to cancer among other illnesses, and he left a hole in my life. He played guitar, which led me to try it myself a few years after he died, and I somehow stuck with it. In about 2016 our my mother caved and we got a small dog which I named Tugzo who's 11 but still acts like a puppy. I am deeply passionate about my studies. I habitually watch hours of Netflix and YouTube on end as a flawed attempt to give myself a break. My greatest passions and joys are programming and math, with a close third of creating educational resources such as notes and interactive tools. I was introduced to programming in when I was 9 in year 5 by a teacher that would mentor me in programming and robotics up until year 11, whilst my passion for math started in year 9 when I was put in a lower band than I expected. I define myself by many key traits, but one of most rigid is honesty. I refuse to "say things that are untrue with intent to deceive whilst outside of a game and with exception of my youngest brother" (because it is funny to mess with him). I do this for many benefits such as not having to lie, not getting into spirals of dishonesty, and people being able to take my word for things. My favorite: poem is 'The View from Halfway Down' from BoJack Horseman, band is 'fun.', novel is Scythe by Neil Shusterman, and movie is Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach. I am not a religious person, but if I had to describe myself I would be somewhere between agnostic and Christian, as there is a lot I don't agree with, and even more I don't understand. I am politically undecided. I have right-leaning parents, and left-leaning friends, and I am somewhere in the middle while I figure out what I do and do not believe / agree with. I have always thought of myself as socially awkward. I am not the type of person who needs a lot of friends. For almost the entirety of high school, I would consistently be in a group of exactly 4 close knit friends. Those 4 people would change, with Bede and Kyle becoming Samuel and Gavith, and Samuel and Naomi becoming Daniel and Bidhya, but there would always be 4.
