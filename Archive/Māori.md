# Assimilation
The process of absorbing a people into a dominant culture in society. The goal is for the culture to no longer exist in any distinguishable form. Examples being cultural, linguistic, and religious assimilation.

Examples of policies and approaches:
- Religious converstion
- Removal of children
- Division of land and resources
- Gender roles

# Eugenics
Quickly went from encouraging desirable traits to discouraging undesirable traits:
> "It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind."
> Buck v. Bell, 1927.

> “It has rightly been decided that New Zealand should not only be a white man’s country, but as completely British as possible. We ought to make every effort to keep the stock sturdy and strong, as well as racially pure.” ​
> (Committee of Enquiry into Mental Defectiveness and Sexual Offenders, tasked with incarcerating “miscreants” 1925, quoted in Belich, p. 175). ​

# New Zealand Identity
"Significant aspects of national identity are based on ideals of egalitarianism and lack of racism" (Liu, James H. et al. (1999))

## Tall Poppy Syndrome
Cut down all the flowers to the same size.
- Humility to the extreme.
- Linked to idea of all being equal and the same.

## Egalitarianism 
> Equal rights and opportunities

## Meritocracy
A system in which you get success or power because of their abilities (*merits*), not because of their money or social position.
- Often used as an argument against affirmative action.

## Classless Society?
- 1% of NZ people (40,000) are in control of $1/4$ of the assets.
- Wealth = Opportunities

## Self-deprecating Modesty
Due to [[#Tall Poppy Syndrome]], a lot of New Zealanders adopt a self-deprecating modesty.
# Colonial Utopia
- Early settlers escaping class system.
- Trying to create a 'better Britain' became known as the Britain of the South.
- Fresh start where they could make their own way on their own 'merit' and hard work. However, this only applied to European males - women and minorities had a very different experience.
- New Zealand company selling land that wasn't theirs.

> "Here there is no aristocracy, no snobbery. There are no very rich people and no poor. I’ve not met a beggar ... or seen one destitute person. There are no slums here, no miserable starving women and no suffering children. Here no sober, industrious man need lack any of the comforts of life."
> -William Ranstead, 1900

- As unemployment increased they were used as scapegoats.
