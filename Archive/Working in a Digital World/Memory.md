# Claude-Shannon Experiment
Claude-Shannon invented the idea of a [[#Binary|bit]] (**bi**nary digi**t**).
He wrote a paper on predicting information with entropy. He came up with the idea that you can communicate anything by saying 'Yes' or 'No'.
The experiment was 'I am thinking of a letter, what do you think the next letter is, and he would say 'Yes' or 'No'.
# Binary
If $n$ is the number of bits, then:
- $2^n$ = number of values
- $2^n-1$ = largest number
- $2^{n-1}$ = most significant bit
## Hexadecimal
Base 16: 0-9, A-F
1 Hexadecimal $\to$ 4 Binary Bits

> [!example]
>
> | Hexadecimal | Decimal Pair | Binary    | Decimal |
> | ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ------- |
> | BA          | 11, 10       | 1011 1010 | 186     |
> | AB          | 10 11        | 1010 1011 | 171     |
> | AA          | 10 10        | 1010 1010 | 170     |

# Sound
$22 \text{ kHz}$ as a range is the edge of what humans can hear.
