# Screen Essentialism
*Screen essentialism* is the tendency for people to think of the system as only the interface in front of them (the interface is the system). This course is largely about going beyond that, to understand the mechanisms behind the screen.

# Colors
*Colors* on computers are additive, whereas coloring on paper is subtractive, leading to the usage or RGB instead of RYB.

Each pixel (in a raw uncompressed image) has 3 colour channels. Each colour channel has a byte of data, so it can have 256 values, with a maximum of 255 and a minimum of 0.

## Colour Assimilation
Due to *color assimilation*, our brains connect colours towards their neighbors.

## Colour Constancy
The colour our eye perceives depends on the lighting context. If a green light is shone on a red strawberry, but your brain knows that it should be red, you see it as red.
