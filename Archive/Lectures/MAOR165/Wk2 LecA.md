> "Here there is no aristocracy, no snobbery. There are no very rich people and no poor. Iâ€™ve not met a beggar ... or seen one destitute person. There are no slums here, no miserable starving women and no suffering children. Here no sober, industrious man need lack any of the comforts of life."
> -William Ranstead, 1900
