**Eurocentrism**


Whakatika Report, 2021: 93% of Māori experienced racism daily (racial profiling, negative portrayls in media, police brutality, unequity in justice and healthy systems, etc).

Māori women 20-60: 15% of population but make up 63% of women in prison.

# What is Racism?
Prejudice and discrimination

"Racism is the acts that enforce the systems and structures of white supremacy. It does this through the construciton of a racial hierarchy that unequally distributes power. For indigenous people, this serves as moral justification for their ongoing dehumanisaiton and teh approriation of their lands and resources through something"

## Constructing Race
- Race is a **social construct** - not biological - means of enforcing power.
- Race exists as **hierarchy** defined by cultural and physical identifiers.

## Social Darwinism
- The root of racism & early definitions of race
- Race defined through biology
- 'Scientifically' estabilished a racial hierachy that establishd white supremacy
- This justified European colonisation and imperialism through their 'superiority' and civilized nature.

## Dehumanization
- Classifying humanity through racial hierarchies
- Moral authority for colonization and defining settler-indigenous relations.

## Systems
- Systems 'determine how resources will be obtained and how they will be redistributed and to whom.' (Reid & Robson, 2007)

## Powers
- Racism = Prejudice + Power
	- Prejudice: 'a belief in the superiority of one race over another" & if there are acted upon, they become discrimination.' (Came, 2012)
	- Power: 'the capacity to exert force on or over something or someone.' (Hoyt Jr., 2012)
	- Discrimination = negative impacts on minorities + maintenance of power for an inequitable system (Whakatika Literature Review, 2021)
	- 'Reverse racism' therefore cannot exist because minorities do not have the institutional power to enforce prejudice.

# Types of Racism
Structural
- Interpersonal
- Institution
- Systemic
Overt | Covert

## Interpersonal Racism
- **What is it?** Racism person acting on a racist beliefs targeting an individual with a racist act - the 'traditional' understanding of racism
- **Examples:** racially motivated attacks, threats, slurs, graffiti & vandalism.
- **Motivation:** Reinforces inequities and 'occurs when interactions between people serve to maintain or exacerbate the unequal distribution of opportunity across ethnoracial groups.' (Berman & Paradies, 2010) - 'know your place'.

## Institutional Racism
- **What is it?** Inequitable outcomes of corporate, organizational, and governmental policies and practices that do not recognize the realities or needs of different communities.
- **Examples:** barriers to accessing health care & education, high arrest & conviction rates compared to Pakeha, negative media portrayals.
- **Motivation:** limits access to and representation in institutions to ensure the maintenance of colonial power and privilege by a community.

# Systemic Racism
- What is it? The relationship between racial inequity within a system of institutions.
	- 'an organized system, rooted in an ideology of inferiority that categorizes, ranks, and differentially allocates societal resources to human population groups.' (Williams & Rucker, 2000)
- Examples: poverty and lack of access to well-resourced educational opportunities limits access to higher education and higher paying careers and financial security. Over policing n racial profiling because of negative media stereotypes creates disproportionate rates of conviction and incarceration.
- Motivation: creates systemic disparities that ensure the maintenance of colonial power and privilege by a community and that Māori do not have the resources or platform to challenge this.

# Structural Racism 
- What is it? Broadest view of racism - describes how all of these forms of racism work together to maintain inequity and white supremacy.
- Example: generations of over policing creates high conviction rates causes high incarceration rates and negative media portrayals limits access to work opportunities, housing, financial, etc.

# Over /// Covert
- New Zealand has long and continuing history of **overt** racism.
- Covert racism can be the result of 'neutral' policy that may not be overtly motivated by racist people or beliefs and manifests in structural, systemic, and institutional racism and the privilege of others.
- This can look like: 'denying the ongoing existence of racism: opposition to policies that benefit minorities; avoiding minority group members; plausible deniability of racist intent through self-justification on the basis of non-racial arguments.' (Liu & Robinson, 1999).

# Racist Reality v National Conscience
If racism is a reality in NZ, why do people not recognize this?
- Taika Waititi: 'racist af' - media outcry
	- Duncan Garner 'I've got a problem with it. Because you have to be accurate as well... I think he's thrown New Zealand under the bus... You cannot be this treasonous about your own country. You can't say you're not proud to be a New Zealander if you're the New Zealander of the year.' (The AM Show, 19 October 2017.)
- Challenging their role & avoidance of white guilt
- White privilege of not being racialized - color blindness
	- '... attribute their advantages to their own hard work while attributed disadvantags of racialized others to personal irresponsibility.' (Salter, et al., 2017)
- Confirmation and validation and bias
