# What
Wellington Hurricane's women's team (Poua) did the haka with altered lyrics: "karetao o te KƒÅwana kakiwhero", apparently translating to "puppets of this redneck government". The teams chief executive expressed disappointment and claimed to have no been consulted, while haka leader claimed that management encouraged them to do it. This change in lyrics is portrayed to be about the 'centre-right coalition government' promising to undo policies promoting the official use of the Maori language.
