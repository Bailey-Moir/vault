1D $=$ $\R$
2D $=$ $\R^2$
3D $=$ $\R^3$

- $|S| > 1 \iff |S| = \infty$
- If the number of equations is smaller than the number of variables, then $|S| \ne 1$.
$$ m < n \implies |S| \ne 1 $$
- Systems in EF are consistent unless a row of coefficients are 0s but the constant isn't.
- If all variables are pivot variables, there is a unique solution.
