A **linear equation** is an equation in which each term is either constant or a constant multiplied by a variable to the first power.
$$ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = b $$
A **system of linear equations** (or **linear system**) is a set or group of linear equations which must all be true simultaneously.

# Consistent and Inconsistent Systems
An *inconsistent system* is a system that doesn't have any solutions, and a *consistent system* is a system that has at least one solution.

## Recognizing Systems
- If one row is a multiple of another row, then they are the same equation and the extra row is redundant.
- If one row of coefficients is the same as another row of coefficients but the constant is different, then the two equations are parallel.
