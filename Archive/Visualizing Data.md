# One Categorical Variable
## Frequency Tables
| Category          | Frequency |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| In a Relationship | 44        |
| It's Complicated  | 20        |
| Single            | 110       |
| Total             | 174       |
Shows the number of cases that fall in each category.
### Relative Frequency Table
| Category          | Frequency |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| In a Relationship | 0.253     |
| It's Complicated  | 0.115     |
| Single            | 0.632     |
| Total             | 1         |

The same as a [[#Frequency Tables|frequency table]], except instead displaying the number of cases, it is the [[Archive/Deatomized/Statistics/Describing Data#Proportion|proportion]] of the cases. All the proportions in a relative frequency table sum to 1.

## Cumulative Counts
If the categorical variable is **logical/ordinal**, then a *cumulative count* is the number of cases at or below a certain level.
## Bar Charts
Displays a categorical variable, where the height corresponds to the number of cases.
## Pie Charts
Displays a categorical variable where the relative area of each slice of the pie corresponds to the proportion in each category.
We prefer not to use these as pie charts are hard to compare.
# Two Categorical Variables
## Two Way Frequency Table

[[#Frequency Tables|Frequency tables]] for two categorical variables.
## Side-by-Side / Clustered Bar Chart
Each bar represents one combination of the categorical variables. 

## Segmented/Stacked Bar Chart
The bars are stacked on top of each other.

### 100% Stacked bar
Uses relative frequencies (all bars have the total same height).

# One Quantitative Variable
## Bell-Shaped
Symmetric and shaped like a bell.

## Histograms
$$ \text{number of bins} = \dfrac{\text{max}-\text{min}}{n} \ni n = 2 \times \text{IQR} \times {n^{-\dfrac{1}{3}}} $$

## Boxplots

Graphical display of [[Archive/Deatomized/Statistics/Describing Data#Five Number Summary|five number summary]].

# Two Quantitative Variables
## Scatterplot
A graph of the association between two quantitative variables.
- Is there a **trend**?
- Is there a **positive** or **negative** [[Correlation|correlation]].
- Is there a **linear association**, or some other curve or pattern.
- Are there any [[Archive/Deatomized/Statistics/Describing Data#Outliers|outliers]]?

# Quantitative/Categorical Relationships.
## Side-by-Side Graphs
![[Pasted image 20240304144131.png]]
*Side-by-side graphs* are used to visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables. It includes a graph for a quantitative variable (e.g. dotplot, [[#Histograms|histograms]], [[#Boxplots|boxplots]]) for each group in the categorical variable, **all using a common numeric axis**

Side by side **boxplots** let us compare the components of the [[Archive/Deatomized/Statistics/Describing Data#Five Number Summary|five number summary]], while **dotplots** let us compare the [[Archive/Deatomized/Statistics/Describing Data#Shape|shape]].
