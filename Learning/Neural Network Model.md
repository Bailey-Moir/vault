A *neural network model* uses a [[Weighted Graphs|weighted graph]] where each [[Vertices|vertex]] (representing a neuron) has an associated **activation value**.
- The interaction between each [[Vertices|vertex]] is characterized by the McCullochâ€“Pitts dynamical rule.[^1]
- The change of [[Weighted Graphs|weights]] and [[Edges|edges]] is represented by the Hebbian learning rule.[^2]
