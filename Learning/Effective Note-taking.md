- Do all recommended readings before class
- If your lecturers have put their lecture notes/Powerpoint slides on LEARN ahead of time, print them off and read them before class.
- Take these printed notes to class.
- Take full notes in lectures, than than just brief notes.
	Why?
- Use abbreviations to save writing time.
- Note should have plenty of space between them.
- Avoid being so busy staking notes that you miss the gist or tone of the lecture.
- Lecture notes should be worked over and learned, preferably on the day they were written.
- The use of colour in underlining headings and in diagrams is recommended.
- Key words and constructed diagrams will help you to bring together ideas and assist the memory.
- Books and hand-outs should be read through twice before your note-making start.

Before:
- Find out what the lecture topic will be from the course outline or AKO | LEARN page.
- Download/print lecture slides if available and read them.
- Revise your notes from the previous lecture and tutorial.
- Complete any recommended readings.
- Set yourself questions you hope the lecture will ask/answer.

During:
- Take detailed notes in class.
	- Identify knowledge gaps and take notes in the margin - add in any questions that you may have.

# Methods
## Cornell Method
3 sections:
- Notes: what the lecturer says
- Summary (bottom): After the lecture
- Review: things to test yourself on or things to remember (?)
## Outline Method
Kind of what I already do.
# Laptops
- Make organized, paraphrased notes, not verbatim transcriptions.
# Using Lecture Recordings
- Optimize working conditions before starting.
- Schedule time to watch recordings and stick to it.
# Lecture Notes
- Add as many detail as you can but not more than you need.
- Don't need to write down what you already know (and won't forget) (stuff that's not new)

Do:
- Write down what is relevant to lecture aims (write down stuff to do with the aim of the lecture)
- Listen out for lecturer's cues indicating importance.
- Keep taking notes during class discussions.

During:
- Work, don't be entertained.
- Take detailed notes in class.
	- Identify knowledge gaps and take notes in the margin - add in any questions that you may have.
- Attend all classes
	- If you miss one, watch online or ask classmate for notes.

Lecture notes are **your own meaningful** account of the info in the lecture. Try to write things in your own words (paraphrase).

# Learning From Your Lecture Notes
![500|center](note-taking-process.excalidraw.md)
There should be a difference between lecture notes, and refined notes (on obsidian).

Prepare, record, Understand, Recall, Apply


Relate information in your notes to previous lectures and readings:
- Keep glossaries, tables, or lists of concepts that you can add to with each new lecture, and use these to create flashcards to test yourself.

Apply:
- Creating questions, write answers/solutions
- Attempt past exam questions.
