When an item is [[Types of Encoding|encoded]], it enters the **short-term store** (**STS**). The STS is thought to be a fixed size. While in the STS, there are three types of association it can go through with the **long-term store** (**LTS**):
- **Autoassociation**
  The association between the cue-stimulus and the (potentially new) entry in the LTS.
  *e.g. associating a cue-card with the information on the other side, associating the idea of [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC]] with its two rules.*
- **Heteroassociation**
  The association between the entry in the LTS and other entries in the LTS that the original entry is related.
  *e.g. associating items in a list with its predecessors and successors, associating [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC]] with [[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic|FTA]].*
- **Context Association**
  The association between the context in which the cue-stimulus was recognized and the entry in the LTS. 
  *e.g. associating a lecture theater with what you learned in it.*

The strength of heteroassociations is thought to be proportional to the amount of time the two items share in the STS (the contiguity effect), whereas the strength of autoassociation and context association are thought to proportional to the time the individual item spends in the STS.

> [!note] See [[Forgetting Curve]] for other variables affecting strength of association.
