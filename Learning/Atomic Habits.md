little habit that is part of a larger system

# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.
- Focus on the system not the goal/results, as the results are a lagging product of the system.
- Achieving a goal doesn't necessarily fix the root problem.
- Goals often lead to people putting off being happy, thinking that "Once I do $x$, I'll be happy."

Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.

# How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

| Outcome-based       | Identity-based    |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| read a book         | become a reader   |
| run a marathon      | become a runner   |
| learn an instrument | become a musician |

We become what we think of ourselves, e.g. "I'm not a morning person".
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins (votes).
# How to Build better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

This creates a feedback loop, as the reward reinforces the behaviour/habit (the strength of the craving). If any of these steps are missing, the loop is broken.

Therefore, in order to form positive habits follow the 4 laws. Ask how you can make it:
1. [[#The 1st Law (Make it Obvious)|Obvious]].
2. [[#The 2nd Law (Make it Attractive)|Attractive]]
3. Easy.
4. Satisfying.

# The 1st Law (Make it Obvious)
## The Man Who Didn't Look Right
- Pointing and calling bad habits when you're about to do them or good habits that you need to do makes you more likely to do the right thing.
- Habit scorecards: a method to become aware of your habits.
## The Best Way to Start a New Habit
### Implementation Intentions
An *implementation intention* is stating something in the general format "When situation $X$ arises, I will perform response $Y$." These have been shown to be extremely effective for sticking to goal. Alternatively, "I will \[BEHAVIOUR\] at \[TIME\] in \[LOCATION\]" can be used. The key for implementation intentions is **lack of ambiguity**.

> [!examples]-
> I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
> I will study Spanish for 20 minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom.
> I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.
> I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.

### Habit Stacking
*Habit stacking*, an alternative form of [[#Implementation Intentions|implementation intention]], uses a pre-existing habit as a cue instead of time and place.
<center>"After [CURRENT HABBIT], I will [NEW HABBIT]."</center>

> [!examples]-
> After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
> After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
> After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I'm grateful for that happened today.
> After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.
> After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take. 
## Environment Design
**Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More**
- Make cues of good habits obvious in your environment, and vice versa.
- It is easier to build hahits in a new environment because you are not fighting cravings from old cues.
- Gradually, a habit becomes associated with the wider context as a cue rather than a single trigger.
- The most persistent behaviours normally have multiple cues.
### The Secret to Self-Control
- The inversion of [[#The 1st Law (Make it Obvious)|the 1st law]] is to make it invisible.
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations/environments; it is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
- Self-control (the way we normally think of it) is a short term solution.
# The 2nd Law (Make it Attractive)
