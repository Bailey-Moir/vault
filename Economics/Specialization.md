*Specialization* makes people more productive, but [[Trade|trade]] makes people better off.

> [!example] 
> If you want a product $A$, but you're much better at producing product $B$, it is more economical (?) to produce $B$ and [[Trade|trade]] it for $A$.
>
> When [[Trade|trade]] is encouraged, more of both $A$ and $B$ are able to be produced.
