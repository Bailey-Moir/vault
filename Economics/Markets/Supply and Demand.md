> **Law of *Supply***
> If the price goes up, sellers will be incentivized to produce more, and if the prices goes down, sellers will be incentivized to produce less.

> **Law of *Demand***
> If the price goes up, buyers will be incentivized to seek alternatives, and if the price goes down, buyers will be incentivized will buy more.

There are 4 key [[Markets|market]] behaviors:
- *supply* decreases (then the *supply curve* shifts to the left),
- *supply* increases (then the *supply curve* shifts to the right).
- *demand* decreases (then the *demand curve* shifts to the left).
- *demand* increases (then the *demand curve* shifts to the right).

> [!definition]- Equilibrium
> - The **equilibrium price** of a product is the price at which the quantity *supplied* is equal to the quantity in *demand*.
> - The **equilibrium quantity** of a product is the quantity *demanded* or *supplied* at **equilibrium price**.
