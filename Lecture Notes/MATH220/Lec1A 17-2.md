# Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptosystems
- **Symmetric**
	Alice and Bob use the same key (a shared secret).
- **Asymmetric (Public Key)**
	Alice has a key for encryption, and Bob has a key for decryption.

| **Symmetric**                       | **Asymmetric**           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Typically more secure and efficient | Do not need a shared key |
