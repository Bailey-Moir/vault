Algorithms can be described using:
- Natural language (e.g. English)
- Pseudocode
- Program

In decreasing in importance, algorithms must be
- Correct
- Scalable
	- time
	- space
	- etc
- Other: simple, clever, etc.
# Correctness
An algorithm is said to be *correct* iff for each input, it halts and gives the desired output. This requires a proof. In computer science, this is often done with [[Induction|induction]] or [[Proof by Contradiction|proof by contradiction]], or disproven using a counter-example.
# Analysis
Once correctness if verified, we are normally interested in time complexity and space complexity.
