- The zero variance indicates that all of the data collection data points are equally important.
- $\text{Var}(X + C) = \text{Var}(X)$, where $X$ is a random variable and $C$ is a constant.
- $\text{Var}(CX) = C^2Var(X)$, where C is a constant.
- $\displaystyle \text{Var}\left(\sum x_i\right) = \sum \text{Var}(x_i)$ where $\{x_n\}$[^1] are independent random variables.
