For a [[Goodness-of-fit|goodness-of-fit test]], we need a [[Test Statistic|test statistic]] to compare observed to expected and generate a [[p-value|p-value]].

The $\chi^2$ statistic, is found by comparing the observed counts from a sample with expected counts derived from a [[Statistical Hypotheses|null hypothesis]], given by:
$$ \chi^2 = \sum\dfrac{(\text{observed} - \text{expected})^2}{\text{expected}} $$
This is generally useful when each count is at least 5.
