When selecting random samples of size $n$ from a population with [[Mean|mean]] $\mu$ and [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] $\sigma$, the distribution of sample means ($\overline x$) is below, provided $n$ is sufficiently large.
$$ \overline x \sim N\left( \mu, \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$
