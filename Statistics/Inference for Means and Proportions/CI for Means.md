If $t^*$ is an endpoint chosen from a [[t-distributions|t-distribution]] with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom to give the desired [[Confidence Interval|level of confidence]], and $n \ge 30$ or the population is approximately normal, then the confidence interval for $\mu$ is:
$$\text{CI} = x \pm t^* \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
where $s$ is the [[Standard Deviation|sample standard deviation]]
