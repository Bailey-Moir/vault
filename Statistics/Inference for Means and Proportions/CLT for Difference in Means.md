This only deals with proportions from two distinct groups (i.e., it would have to be coincidence for $n_1 = n_2$). If it is [[Paired Data|paired data]], then [[CLT for Mean Differences|central limit theorem for mean differences]]. When selecting random samples of sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ from a population with means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ respectively, the distribution of the difference in sample means ($\overline x_1 - \overline x_2$) is below, provided $n$ is sufficiently large.
$$ \overline x_1 - \overline x_2 \sim N\left( \mu_1 - \mu_2, \sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{n} + \dfrac{\sigma_2^2}{n}} \right) $$

> If $n_1 \ge 30$ and $n_2 \ge 30$, a normal distribution is usually a good approximation.
