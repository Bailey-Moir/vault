If the differences are approximately normal or $n_d \ge 30$ (conditions for a [[t-distributions|t-distribution]]), a CI for the mean difference below, where $t^*$ is an endpoint on a [[t-distributions|t-distribution]] with $n_d - 1$ degrees of freedom.
$$ \text{statistic} \pm t^* SE = \overline x_d \pm t^* \dfrac{s_d}{\sqrt{n_d}}$$
