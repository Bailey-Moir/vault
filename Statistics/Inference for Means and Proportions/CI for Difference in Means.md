If $t^*$ is an endpoint chosen from a [[t-distributions|t-distribution]] with $\text{min}(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)$ degrees of freedom to give the desired [[Confidence Interval|level of confidence]], and the conditions for the [[CLT for Difference in Means|central limit theorem for difference in means]] is met or the populations are approximately normal, then the confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is:
$$\text{CI} = \overline x_1 - \overline x_2 \pm t^* \sqrt{\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

\[[[CLT for Difference in Means]], [[Confidence Interval]]\]
