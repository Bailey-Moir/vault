This only deals with variables from two distinct groups (i.e., it would have to be coincidence for the two sample sizes to be the same), not [[Paired Data|paired data]].
When selecting random samples from a [[Population v. Sample|population]] with variables $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ respectively, the distribution of the difference in sample variables ($\hat \theta_1 - \hat \theta_2$) is below, provided the sample sizes are sufficient.
$$ \hat \theta_1 - \hat \theta_2 \sim  \mathcal{N}\left( \theta_1 - \theta_2, \sqrt{\text{SE}_1^2 + \text{SE}_2^2} \right) $$
