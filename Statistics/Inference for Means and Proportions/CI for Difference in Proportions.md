$$\text{CI} = \hat p_1 - \hat{p}_2 \pm z^* \sqrt{\dfrac{\hat p_1(1 - \hat p_1)}{n_1} + \dfrac{\hat p_2(1 - \hat p_2)}{n_2}}$$
Note that we have used our $\hat p_1$ and $\hat p_2$  as our best guesses for $p_1$ and $p_2$. See [[CLT for Difference in Proportions|central limit theorem for difference in proportions]] for an explanation and conditions.
