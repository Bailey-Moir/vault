When the conditions for a [[Simple Linear Model|simple linear model]] are met, a [[Confidence Interval|confidence interval]] for the [[Population v. Sample|population]] **slope** is:
$$ b_1 \pm t^* \text{SE} $$
where $b_1$ is the [[Point Estimate|point estimate]] of the slope, $SE$ is the [[Standard Error|standard error]] of the slope and $t^*$ is an endpoint chose from a [[t-distributions|t-distribution]] with $\bf{n-2}$ degrees of freedom.
