A measure of the direction and strength of the **linear association** between the two [[Variable Types|quantitative variables]].
$$\begin{align*} 
	r &= \dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum \left[ \left( \dfrac{x - \overline{x}}{s_x} \right) \left( \dfrac{y - \overline{y}}{s_y} \right) \right] \\
	&= \dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum (z_x \times z_y)
\end{align*}$$
- $-1 \le r \le 1$
- The sign indicates the direction of association (the sign of the gradient).
- *Correlation* is unit free, and is independent of the scale of either variable (comparable between data sets).
- *Correlation* between $x$ an $y$ is the same as the correlation between $y$ and $x$ ([[Symmetric Property|symmetric]]).

| Strength    | \|$\large r$\| |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Very weak   | $0$ - $0.2$    |
| Weak        | $0.2$ - $0.4$  |
| Moderate    | $0.4$ - $0.6$  |
| Strong      | $0.6$ - $0.8$  |
| Very Strong | $0.8$ - $1$    |

Sample Correlation Coefficient $= r$
Population Correlation Coefficient $= \rho$
