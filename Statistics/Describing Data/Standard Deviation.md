Measures the **spread** of a [[Variable Types|quantitative variable]]; simply how different things are on [[Mean|average]] (from the [[Mean|average]]).
$$\begin{align*}
	\text{standard deviation} &= \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum(x-\overline{x})^2}{n-1}} \\
\end{align*}$$
This gives the typical distance of a data value from the mean.
Sample STD $= s$
Population STD $= \sigma$

*Standard deviation* is not [[Resistance|resistant]]
