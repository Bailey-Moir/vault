Data is *paired* if the data being compared consists of paired data values. For matched pairs experiments, we look at the **difference** between the responses **for each [[Cases and Variables|case]]**, rather than the average difference between groups.

$$\begin{array}{rl}
	\overline x_d & \text{sample mean differences} \\
	s_d & \text{standard deviation of differences} \\
	n_d & \text{number of differences} \\
\end{array}$$

>  > **Separate Samples**
>  > The [[Cases and Variables|cases]] are split into difference groups and the treatment is varied between them (a [[Randomisation Experiments|randomised comparative experiment]]).
>  
>  > **Paired Data**
>  > Each [[Cases and Variables|case]] gets both treatments, recording both (a [[Randomisation Experiments|matched pairs experiment]].
