Statistical test are framed formally in terms of two competing *hypotheses* about the population:
> **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$**)**
> Claim that there is no effect or no difference (nothing happening).

> **Alternate Hypothesis (**$H_a$**)**
> Claim for which we seek significant evidence (something happening).

$$\begin{array}{ccccccc} 
	H_0 : \theta = k &&& H_0 : \theta = k &&& H_0 : \theta = k \\
	H_a : \theta < k &&& H_a : \theta \ne k &&& H_a : \theta > k &&
\end{array}$$
- Hypotheses are always written in terms of [[Statistics and Parameters|population parameters]], not [[Statistics and Parameters|sample statistics]].
- The null hypothesis ($H_0$) contains an equality.
- The alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) always contains an inequality ($<$, $>$, or $\ne$).
- **Never accept $H_0$**
