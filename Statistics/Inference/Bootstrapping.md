*Bootstrapping* is generating random samples taken with replacement from the original sample, of the **same size** as the original sample (called **bootstrap samples**) to calculate the [[Standard Error|standard error]].

> **Bootstrap Statistic**
> A statistic computed on a bootstrap sample.

> **Bootstrap Distribution**
> A distribution of many **bootstrap statistics**.

The [[Sampling Distributions|sampling distribution]] is centred around the [[Statistics and Parameters|population parameter]], where as bootstrap distributions are centred around the [[Statistics and Parameters|sample statistic]].

The variability of bootstrap distributions are similar to that of distributions from different samples. Thus, the standard error of a statistic can be estimated using the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution.
