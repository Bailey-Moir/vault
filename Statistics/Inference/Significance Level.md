Similar in purpose to [[Confidence Interval|confidence levels]], significance levels ($\alpha$) are the threshold below which a [[p-value|p-value]] is deemed small enough to reject the [[Statistical Hypotheses|null hypothesis]]. 
$$\begin{align*}
	p\text{-value} < \alpha &\implies \text{Reject } H_0 \\
	p\text{-value} \ge \alpha &\implies \text{Do not Reject } H_0
\end{align*}$$
- Often $\alpha = 0.05$ unless otherwise specified.
