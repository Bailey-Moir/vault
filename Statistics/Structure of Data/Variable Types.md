| Type         | Description                                                                                                           |

| Quantitative | Measures a numerical quantity for a case.                                                                             |
| Categorical  | Divides the cases into groups. <br/> If there is a natural order of categories, then they are said to be **logical**. |

> [!Caution]
> Numbers are not always quantitative (e.g. number of people in a family is categorical because it represents distinct categories rather than being continuous).
