In a *randomised experiment*, the value of the [[Explanatory and Response Variables|explanatory variable]] for each [[Cases and Variables|case]] is determined randomly, before the response variable is measured. This method avoids confounding variables. 
All *randomised experiments* need either a [[Control Groups|control group]], or two different treatments to compare
> **Randomised Comparative Experiment**
> Randomly assigning cases to different groups and compare results of the response variable.

> **Matched Pairs Experiment**
> Each case gets both treatments in random order (or cases get paired up in some other obvious way), and we examine individual differences in the response variable between the two treatments.
