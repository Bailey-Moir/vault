A Poisson random variable counts the number of times an [[Events|event]] occurs in an interval of time or space.

# Conditions
For a process to give a **Poisson random variable**:
- [[Events|Events]] must occur at a **constant average rate** $\lambda > 0$ per interval of time or space.
- The occurrences must be **[[Independent Events|independent]]**.
- Multiple occurrences cannot happen at exactly the same time or in exactly the same place.
