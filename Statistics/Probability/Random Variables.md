A *random variable* is a variable that **takes a single numerical value for each outcome in a random process** - a numerical quantity that changes from trial to trial in a random process.

> $X =$ number of coin tosses until the first head appears
> $Y =$ Sum of two dice rolls
> $G =$ Grade on next Learn quiz
> $T =$ Time to run 100 metre

A *random variable* is **discrete** if it takes countably many values.
A *random variable* is **continuous** if it takes any value within some interval.
