*Independent events* are unrelated [[Events|events]] - the outcome of one [[Events|event]] does not influence the outcome of the other [[Events|events]].
[[Events|Events]] $A$ and $B$ are *independent* iff
$$P(A|B) = P(A),$$
and by the [[Conditional Probability|conditional probability formula]], this is [[Logical Equivalence|logically equivalent]] to
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$$
