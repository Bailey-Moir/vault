*Tree diagrams* are [[Weighted Graphs|weighted]] [[Directed Graphs|directed]] [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Definitions/Trees|trees]] where each [[Vertices|vertex]] represents an [[Events|event]], with the [[Edges|edge]] from $A$ to be $B$ having weight $P(B|A)$[^1].
1. The total weight of [[Edges|edges]] from each [[Vertices|vertex]] is $1$.
2. Multiplying edges along a [[Walks|path]] gives the probability of the outcome.
