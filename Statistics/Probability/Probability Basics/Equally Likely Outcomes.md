If all possible outcomes are equally likely, the [[Probabilities|probability]] of an [[Events|event]] $A$ is
$$ P(A) = \dfrac{\left| A \right|}{\left| \ohm \right|} $$
> [!example]-
> If we toss a fair coin twice, the [[Probabilities|probability]] that both tosses give the same outcome is
> $$P(HH,TT) = \dfrac{2}{4} = \dfrac{1}{2}$$
> Here $A = \{HH, TT\}$ and $\ohm = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$
