An *event* is any collection/[[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Sample Space|sample space]], something that either happens or doesnâ€™t happen. 

> [!example]-
> If we toss a fair coin twice, then the [[Sample Space|sample space]] is
> $$\ohm = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$$
> The event that both tosses give the same outcome is
> $$ A = \{HH, TT\} $$
