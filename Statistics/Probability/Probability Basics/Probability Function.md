A *probability function* $P$ is a [[Functions|function]] from $\ohm$[^1] to $\R$ satisfying the axioms:
1. $\forall A \in \mathcal{P}(\ohm), 0 \le P(A) \le 1$[^2][^1]
2. $P(\emptyset) = 0 \land P(\ohm) = 1$[^3][^1]
3. If $A$ and $B$ are [[Disjoint Events|disjoint events]] in $\ohm$[^1], $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

A *probability function* assigns a [[Probabilities|probability]] to every value of a [[Random Variables|discrete random variable]]. The sum of all of these [[Probabilities|probabilities]] must be one.
