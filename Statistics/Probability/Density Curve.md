A theoretical model for the distribution of a [[Random Variables|continuous random variable]] and has two important properties:
- The total area under the curve is equal to one
  $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x) \, dx = 1$[^1]
- The area over any [[Math/Algebra/Basics/Intervals|interval]] is the [[Proportion|proportion]] of the distribution in that interval.
  $\displaystyle P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b p(x) \, dx$
