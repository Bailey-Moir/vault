Twitter suspended his account for harassment because of this tweet.
# Outlined Message
1) Twitter banned me and didn't tell me exactly why, so now I have to "guess" ðŸ˜­
2) Pride is a sin, not a virtue. Pride isn't something to be celebrated.
3) Sexual desire and orientation are not things to celebrate or take pride in.
4) Dead naming was necessary to make the point.
5) Was Eliot a he or she when they had their breasts were removed? If they were a he, why were the male breasts removed? If they were female, then wasn't he still a she?
6) This would be confusing if proper pronouns/names were used, as it would not be clear if it were female or male breasts that were removed. How could I have described the act (removing the breasts) without using the dead name or old pronouns?
7) "Eliot page just had *his* breasts removed? Was he Eliot then? When exactly, exactly."
8) The 'dead naming' category doesn't exist.
9) Eliot is a role model, and as a star, has responsibilities. By agreeing to the surgery and publicizing it, and by insisting on its morality, they influenced adolescents to transition due to their hormonal gender self-consciousness.
10) 'Criminal physician' was just wrong, lol, mb.
11) We shouldn't actively help those who are confused about their gender identity because, "do no harm", and "sins of omission are less egregious than sins of commission". Thus, leaving someone with gender dysphoria, however warrented, to suffer the mismatch is less of a risk than actively intervening with gender confirming care.

- "appalling censorial terminology of the insane activists"
- "except in the censorial and addled minds of a tiny fraction of insanely narcissistic and increasingly dangerous trans activists"

there's a lot more, I can't be bothered to write it all done

12) It's obvious.
13) Pride is used as in being proud, which is fine, I think...
14) I think that might be a generational thing. Sex positivity is good. I like it.
15) No it wasn't, and I'll address this in (5) and (6).
16) Their gender identity was not determined by their breasts, it was determined by what they chose, internally, to identify as.
17) Just call them by their current pronouns/name, and preface by mentioning that they are a trans man.
18) See (5)
19) All categories don't exist then. We make them up. Like, this shit is so stupid.
20) This is the only genuine point so I will dedicate a section to it.
21) There are multiple factors that go into the weight of a sin, so this implication is false.

I do agree that he may have influenced teen transitions that will be regretted. However, what is the alternative? That they not have the right to transition, or that he remove himself from the public eye somehow? This alternative seems much worse to me, as it is violating his rights.

Yes, it is a lose-lose, but I think that the lesser of two evils was chosen. I don't know how to justify this in any sort of objective way.
