1. If you dress up well or spend ages on make up, you shouldn't be upset about being called hot.
2. Sexual liberation (promiscuity) and fighting objectification are at odds with one another. You can't complain about being objectified if you objectify yourself or promote that women should be free to objectify themselves. Feminism used to be very against pornography, but now it's glorifying OnlyFans and other adult content as a means of self-empowerment.
3. Feminism used to be really good, but now it's not.
4. Attacking and or putting down people who want to be house wives is stupid. Feminism is about empowering women to make their own choices, including to be a house wife.
5. Women have to give up certain freedoms (casual sex, pornography) if they want things like not to be objectified.
6. The gender pay gap isn't real. Women are payed less on average as they often go into lower payed jobs. For example, women often go into teaching and nursing, where men often go into truck driving or being a car mechanic. If they want to get into other jobs, there is nothing stopping them.
7. Red pill dumb.

0. The graph in the thumbnail has nothing to do with loneliness ([source](https://www.ft.com/content/29fd9b5c-2f35-41bf-9d4c-994db4e12998))
1. I dress up well, but I don't dress up so girls will notice me or objectify me, I do it because it makes me feel good. It's about self-respect and confidence.
2. "Women" aren't a single entity. They are a collection of people, most of whom aren't on OnlyFans or objectifying themselves. For those who don't, these points don't apply. For those who do, one could argue they are being selfish? They see a system that they can't fix, one that oppresses them and objectifies them, and try to take advantage of it. "If I'm gonna be objectified, may as well make some money off it." It's not the most virtuous position to take, but it's very understandable, and that sort of logic is common place in modern society.  
3. See other points.
4. This is correct. People who do that are cringe.
5. Sure, I don't personally think casual sex is good. But I do think it is important that women aren't disproportionately judged for it (when compared to men). We're not gonna instantly judge men as much as we did women (nor should we, that's way too much), so yeah, no, you're just wrong.
6. If the primary demographic of nurses were men, do you think they would be paid more? I think they would.
7. Mhmm.
