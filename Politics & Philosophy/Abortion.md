# Pro-Life
- murder is bad: deontology
- abortion is an easy alternative
- in cases or rape or incest, taking drugs after the event can **prevent** pregnancy.

# Pro-Choice
- people should have the right: consequentialism/utilitarianism?
- forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy is similar to forcing them to use contraception or sterilization (reproductive rights).

# The Implications of My Pro-Choice Stance
Deontology is a tool, a rule of thumb. It is not a hill that one should die on, however I do agree that it is very tempting sometimes. For example, if you asked me to kill someone to save a bunch of others, or some sort of trolley problem-esk situation, the deontological rules in my brain would make it very, very hard for me to kill them. However, I see this as a weakness; if you are able to surpass this, it does not make you evil, it makes you stronger.

I am not suggesting that people should transcend morality, just that they should look beyond deontology. Where do our deontological rules come from? If your answer is religion... too bad I'm not gonna address that, I don't feel like it. For an atheist, a common answer would be utilitarianism. Yet, it could be argued that utilitarianism says that abortion should be legal, as the fetus does not care but the women with their rights removed certainly do. So am I suggesting we should just adopt a utilitarianist mindset when thinking bigger picture?

What are the short comings of utilitarianism? The classic 'doing the wrong thing for the right reason'. Michael W. Austin Ph.D. at Psychology Today says "Utilitarianism requires that one commit unjust actions in certain situations, and because of this it is fundamentally flawed. Some things ought never to be done, regardless of the positive consequences that may ensue."[^1] which I think sums up the seeming incompatibility and yet necessity of deontology and utilitarianism.

In my mind, they can't be married. In the end, you have to pick one, and as a math major, I pick utilitarianism. Thus: yes, we should fall back on utilitarianism ðŸ˜Š.
