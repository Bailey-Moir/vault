A *subcategory* of a [[Categories|category]] $C$ is another [[Categories|category]] $B$ formed from a [[Subsets|subset]] of the objects and morphisms of $C$ with the same [[Composite Functions|composition]] and identities as $C$.

> [!definition] A *subcategory* $B$ of $C$ is **full** iff $\forall x,y \in B, B(x,y) = C(x,y)$<br/>*i.e. iff only orphaned morphisms are removed.*
