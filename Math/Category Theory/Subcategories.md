A *subcategory* of a [[Categories|category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is another [[Categories|category]] $\mathcal{B}$ formed from a [[Subsets|subset]] of the objects and morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ with the same [[Composite Functions|composition]] and identities as $\mathcal{C}$.

> [!definition] A *subcategory* $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is **full** iff $\forall x,y \in \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}(x,y) = \mathcal{C}(x,y)$<br/>*i.e. iff only orphaned morphisms are removed.*
