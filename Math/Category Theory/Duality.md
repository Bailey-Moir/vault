We define the elementary language of [[Categories|category theory]] as the two sorted [[Fiest-Oreer Languages|first order language]] with
- objects and morphisms as the distinct sorts, together with 
- [[Relations|relations]] of an object being the source or target of a morphism, and
- a symbol for [[Composite Functions|composition]] morphisms.

Let $\sigma$ be a [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] in this language. The *dual* of this statement $\sigma^\text{op}$ is the same as $\sigma$, except:
- The "source" and "target" [[Relations|relations]] are swapped, and
- The order of [[Composite Functions|composition]] is swapped (every $f \circ g$ becomes $g \circ f$).
