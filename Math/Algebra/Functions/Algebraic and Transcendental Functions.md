*Algebraic functions* are any type of function that can be constructed using algebraic operations starting with polynomials, e.g.:
$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
	\sqrt{x^2+1} && \dfrac{x^4 - 16x^2}{x+\sqrt{x}} + (x-2)\sqrt[3]{x+1}
\end{array}
$$
Functions that are not algebraic are called *transcendental*. These include the trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions.
