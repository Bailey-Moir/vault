*Even functions* are symmetrical across the $y$-axis, and *odd functions* are even but flipped vertically across the $y$-axis. 
- A [[Functions|function]] $f:A\to B$ is *even* iff $\forall a\in A,f(-a) = f(a)$
- A [[Functions|function]] $f:A\to B$ is *odd* iff $\forall a\in A,f(-a) = -f(a)$

# Even and Odd Polynomials
- For a polynomial to be *even*, it must have exclusively **even powers** of $x$ (including $x^0$).
- For a polynomial to be *odd*, it must have exclusively **odd powers** of $x$.
