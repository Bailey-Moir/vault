An **open interval** from $a$ to $b$ consists of all numbers between endpoints $a$ and $b$, denoted as:
$$ (a,b) = \left\{ x : a < x < b \right\} $$

A **closed interval** from $a$ to $b$ consists of all numbers between and including endpoints $a$ and $b$, denoted as:
$$ [a,b] = \left\{ x : a \le x \le b \right\} $$
