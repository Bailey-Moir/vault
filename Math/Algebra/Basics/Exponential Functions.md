$$f(x) = b^x$$
$$ b > 0 \implies f : \R \to (0,\infty) $$
- If $b>1$, then the function increases as $x$ increases (exponential growth)
- If $b=1$, then the value of $b^x$ is constant, and the function is constant.
- If $0<b<1$, then the function decreases as $x$ increases (exponential decay)

# The Natural Exponential Function
$$ \text{exp}(x) = e^x $$
An exponential function with a base of [[Euler's Number|Euler's number]] $e$, sometimes called '**the** exponential function'. The natural exponential function has the (almost) unique property of being its own [[Archive/Deatomized/Calculus/Differentiation|derivative]] (with exception of $f(x) = 0$).
$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \exp(x) = \exp(x) $$
