Inequalities *tend* to work the same as normal equations, except for the fact that inverting or flipping the sign of an equation flips the direction of the inequality (this rule can be used to explain behaviour behind [[Absolute Values|absolute values]]).
- $a<b \implies a+c<b+c$
- $a<b \land c > 0 \implies ac<bc$
- $a<b \land c < 0 \implies ac>bc$
- $a > 0 \implies \dfrac{1}{a} > 0$
- $a,b > 0 \land a < b \implies \dfrac{1}{b} < \dfrac{1}{a}$
