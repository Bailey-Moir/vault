The coordinates we are used to are called Cartesian coordinates, in the form $(x,y)$. Instead, *polar form* is $(r,\theta)$, where 
- $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is the **radial coordinate** : the distance from the **pole**/origin denoted as $O$.
- $\theta = \text{atan2}\,(y,x)$ is the **angular coordinate** : the angle of the point from the **polar axis** (a ray at $O$ going right).
