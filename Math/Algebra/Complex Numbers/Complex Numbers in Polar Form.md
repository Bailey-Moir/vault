$$\begin{align*}
	z &= a + bi \\
	  &= re^{i\theta} && (1) \\
	  &= |z|e^{i\arg{z}} \\
\end{align*}$$
\[$(1)$ [[Euler's (Complex) Formula]]\]

[[Polar Form|Polar form]] can be used as an alternative to the [[Rectangular Form|rectangular form]] of [[Complex Numbers|complex numbers]] ($a+bi$). When [[Polar Form|polar form]] is used in terms of [[Complex Numbers|complex numbers]],
- The [[Polar Form|radial coordinate]] is defined as $r = |z|$, and is called the [[Complex Modulus|modulus]].
- The [[Polar Form|angular coordinate]] is defined as $\theta = \arg z$, and is called the **argument**.

There are infinitely many arguments that satisfy each [[Complex Numbers|complex number]]. The principal argument (denoted $\text{Arg}\, z$) is the argument that also satisfies $\theta \in \left(-\pi,\pi\right]$[^1] ($-\pi < \theta \le \pi$).
