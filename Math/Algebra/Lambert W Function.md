The *Lambert $W$ function* $W(x)$ is defined as the [[Math/Discrete/Set Theory/Functions/Inverse Functions|inverse function]] of $f(x)=xe^x$.
- $W(xe^x) = x$
- $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$

>  In order for $f$ to have an [[Math/Discrete/Set Theory/Functions/Inverse Functions|inverse]], it is restricted to the [[Domain|domain]] of $\left[ -1,\infty \right)$ as to be [[Injective Functions|injective]], with a [[Range|range]] of $\left[-\frac{1}{e},\infty\right)$. Thus, $W: \left[-\frac{1}{e},\infty\right) \to \left[ -1,\infty \right)$.
