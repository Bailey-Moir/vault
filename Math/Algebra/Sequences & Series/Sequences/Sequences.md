$$\begin{array}{rcccl}
	\left\{\dfrac{1}{2^n}\right\} && a_n = \dfrac{1}{2^n} && \left\{\dfrac{1}{2},\: \dfrac{1}{4},\: \dfrac{1}{8},\: \dots,\: \dfrac{1}{2^n},\: \dots\right\}
\end{array}$$
An infinite sequence, can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order, meaning, meaning that each term $a_n$ will have a successor $a_{n+1}$:
$$ a_1,\: a_2,\: a_3,\: \dots,\: a_n,\: \dots$$
Therefore, an infinite sequence that starts at $1$ can be denoted as $f: \N \to E$ where $E$ is some set.
