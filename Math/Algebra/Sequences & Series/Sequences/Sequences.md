A *sequence* is a [[Functions|function]] that maps the [[Natural Numbers|naturals]] to the [[The Real Numbers|reals]] ($f:\N\to\R$). A *sequence* is not always explicitly defined for every [[Natural Numbers|natural number]], but this is tolerated as we are interested in long-term behaviour.

> [!notation] $f: \Z^+ \to \R \text{ s.t. } f(n) = n^2 \iff \left( n^2 \right)_{n=1}^\infty$
