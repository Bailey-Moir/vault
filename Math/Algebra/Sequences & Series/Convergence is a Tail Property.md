The [[Convergence of Sequences|convergence]] and [[Convergence of Sequences|limit]] of a [[Sequences|sequence]] is unchanged if either
1. we alter finitely many terms, or
2. we add (or remove) finitely many terms at the beginning.

# Convergence of Series
The [[Convergence of Sequences|convergence]] of a [[Series|series]] is unchanged if either
1. we alter finitely many terms, or
2. we add (or remove) finitely many terms at the beginning.
