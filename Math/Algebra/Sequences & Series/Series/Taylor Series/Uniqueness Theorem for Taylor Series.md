If a [[Power Series|power series]] converges to $f$ for all $x$ in some [[Math/Algebra/Basics/Intervals|open interval]] containing $\alpha$, then $f$ is infinitely differentiable on the [[Math/Algebra/Basics/Intervals|open interval]], and the [[Power Series|power series]] is the [[Taylor Series|Taylor series]] of $f$ about $\alpha$.
