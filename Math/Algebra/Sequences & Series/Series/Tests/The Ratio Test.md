For a [[Series|series]] $\Sigma a_{k}$, let $\displaystyle\rho = \lim \left|\dfrac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right|$ (the [[Convergence of Sequences|limit]] of the ratio between successive terms).
- If $\rho < 1$, the series is [[Absolute Convergence|absolutely convergent]].
- If $\rho > 1$, the series diverges.
