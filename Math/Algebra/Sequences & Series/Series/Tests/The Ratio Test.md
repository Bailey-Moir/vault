For a [[Series|series]] $\Sigma a_{n}$, if $\displaystyle\rho = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left|\dfrac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|$ (the limit of the ratio between terms),
- If $\rho < 1$, the series is [[Absolute Convergence|absolutely convergent]].
- If $\rho = 1$, the test is inconclusive.
- If $\rho > 1$, the series diverges.
