A *series* is very similar to a [[Sequences|sequence]], except all of the terms are added to each other.
- For all $K \in \Z$, $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_n$ converges iff $\displaystyle \sum_{k=K}^\infty a_n$ converges.
- If $\lim_{ n \to \infty } a_{n} \ne 0$, $\Sigma a_{n}$ diverges (the "Test for Divergence").
