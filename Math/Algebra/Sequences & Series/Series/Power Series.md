A *power series* about $a$ is a [[Series|series]] of the form
$$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\left( x-a \right)^n = c_0 + c_1\left( x-a \right) + c_2\left( x-a \right)^2 + \cdots $$
> [!note]- When $a=0$ and $\exists k : \forall n, c_n = k$, this is a [[Geometric Series|geometric series]] with a ratio of $x$.
