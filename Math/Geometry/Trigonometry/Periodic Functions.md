*Periodic functions* are functions that repeat themselves after a regular interval. This interval is called the **period** of the function. The basic trigonometric functions ($\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$) are all periodic.

> **Period**
> The regular interval on which a given **periodic** function repeats.

> **Amplitude**
> Half the distance from the lowest point on the graph of the function to the highest point on the graph.
