Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
$0<\theta<{\Large\frac{\pi}2}$ | ${\Large\frac{\pi}2}<\theta<\pi$ | $\pi<\theta<{\Large\frac{3\pi}2}$ | ${\Large\frac{3\pi}2}<\theta<2\pi$
$\theta$ cycles through quadrants infinitely, so if  $2\pi<\theta<{\Large\frac{5\pi}2}$, then $\theta$ is in Q1; the table holds true if $\theta$ is set to $mod(\theta, 2\pi)$. The quadrants represent the below areas, where $\sin\theta$ is <span style="color:FF5956;">red</span>, $\tan\theta$ is <span style="color:#44A1FF;">blue</span>, and $\cos\theta$ is <span style="color:#6BFF81;">green</span>. As you can see, all are positive in Q1, and then $\sin\theta$, $\tan\theta$, and finally $\cos\theta$.

Creating a triangle inside the quadrants can allow you to find the value of $\theta$ (often using [[Special Triangles|special triangles]]). It should be noted that the interior angle of these triangle are always against the horizontal line. For more specifics, look at [this calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aqvg9qip6p).
