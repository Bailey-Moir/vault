Let $F$ be a fixed point (the focus), $l$ be a fixed line (the directrix), and $e$ be a fixed positive number (the eccentricity). The set of all points $P$ in plane such that
$$ \dfrac{\left|PF\right|}{\left|Pl\right|} = e $$
(the ratio of the distances of $F$ and $l$ from $P$ is the $e$) describes
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
	e<1 & \text{elipse} \\
	e=1 & \text{parabola} \\
	e>1 & \text{hyperbola} \\
\end{array}
$$
In [[Polar Form|polar form]], a [[conic sections|conic section]] of eccentricity $e$ can be represented as
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
	r=\dfrac{k}{\dfrac{1}{e}\pm\cos\theta} & \text{or} & r=\dfrac{k}{\dfrac{1}{e}\pm\sin\theta}
\end{array}$$
