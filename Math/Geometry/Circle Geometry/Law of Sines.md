$$ \dfrac{\sin \alpha}{a} = \dfrac{\sin \beta}{b} = \dfrac{\sin \gamma}{c} = \dfrac{1}{2R} $$
where $R$ is the radius of the [[Circumcircles|circumcircle]]. This is very similar in concept to the [[Law of Cotangents|law of cotangents]]. 
> [!Proof]-
> The chord $\overline{DC}$ (the hypotenuse of the adjusted triangle) passes through the center of the circle $O$, making it the diameter. The inscribed angles $\angle BDC$ and $\angle BAC$ are equivalent (denoted by $\alpha$) as they are subtended by the same arc (see [[Inscribed Angle Theorem|inscribed angle theorem]]). The length of the diameter $\overline{DC}$ can then be easily calculated:
> $$\begin{align*}
> 	\sin \alpha &= \dfrac{a}{2R} \\
> 	\dfrac{\sin \alpha}{a} &= \dfrac{1}{2R} \hspace{1em} \square \\
> \end{align*}$$
