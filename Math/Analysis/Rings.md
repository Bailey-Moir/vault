A *ring* $R$ is a [[Sets|set]] together with two [[Binary Operations|binary operations]] $+$ and $\times$ on $R$ such that
1. $\left( R,+ \right)$ is an [[Groups#^abelian-groups|abelian group]].
2. $\times$ is associative, and
3. it is distributive, meaning $\forall a,b,c \in R,$
   $c(a+b) = ca+cb \;\land$ 
   $(a+b)c = ac+bc$
