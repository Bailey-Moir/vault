A [[Functions|function]] is said to be *analytic* at $t_{0}$ iff its [[Taylor Series|Taylor series]] centred at $t_{0}$ is [[Partial Sums|convergent]] [[Defined Near|near]] (and at) $t_{0}$. 

> [!definition] Otherwise, its [[Radius of Convergence|radius of convergence]] is said to be **empty** (despite being [[Partial Sums|convergent]] at its centre).
