This [[Sequences|sequence]] [[Monotone Sequences|decreases]] by one until it reaches a term $a_{k}$ where $x \geq a_{k}-1$, at which point every subsequent term is equal to $a_{k}$. Since every term has a difference of one up until it reaches $k$, $k$ must exist (to allow [[Convergence of Sequences|convergence]]).
