A *subring* of a [[Rings|ring]] $R$ is a [[Subsets|subset]] $S \subseteq R$ that is a [[Rings|ring]] under induced operations of $R$.

> [!theorem] *(Subring Test)* A [[Empty Set|non-empty]] [[Subsets|subset]] of a [[Rings|ring]] is a *subring* iff it is closed under subtraction and multiplication.

Let $S \in \mathcal{P}(R)\setminus \{ \emptyset \}$

$\left( \implies \right)$
Suppose $S \in \mathcal{P}(R)\setminus \{ \emptyset \}$ is a *subring*. Then every element has an inverse, and it is closed under addition, so it is closed under subtraction, and it is also closed under multiplication.

$\left( \impliedby \right)$
