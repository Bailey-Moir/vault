A finite [[Rings|ring]] $R$ with [[Rings#^unity|unity]] that has no [[Zero-divisors|zero-divisors]] is a [[Fields|field]].

[!proof]
Suppose $R$ is a finite [[Rings|ring]] with [[Rings#^unity|unity]] that has no [[Zero-divisors|zero-divisors]].

Since $R$ is finite, non-[[Zero-divisors|zero-divisors]] (all elements) are [[Rings#^unit|units]][^1]. Thus, all that remains to be shown to give that $R$ is a [[Fields|field]] is that it is [[Groups#^abelian-groups|commutative]].

Let $a,b \in R$. Then
We need to prove $aba^{-1} = b$.

$$\begin{align}
	ba = 
\end{align}$$
