# Rule 1
$$ (A(q) \iff B (q)) \iff (A(p) \iff B(p)) $$
Replacing all occurrences of a [[Primitive Statements|primitive statement]] $p$ in a [[Logical Equivalence|logical equivalence]] with the another [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] $q$ produces a new [[Logical Equivalence|logical equivalence]].

Supposes $A \iff B$. If:
- $P$ is the [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] obtained from $A$ by substituting $q$ for $p$ everywhere in $A$,
- $Q$ is the [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] obtained from $B$ by substituting $q$ for $p$ everywhere in $B$
then $P \iff Q$.

# Rule 2
Replacing part of a [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] with an expression that is [[Logical Equivalence|logically equivalent]] produces a [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] that is [[Logical Equivalence|logically equivalent]].

If $P$ is a [[Statements and Propositions|statement]] and $Q$ is the [[Statements and Propositions|statements]] obtained from $P$ by substituting $q$ for some [[Logical Equivalence|logically equivalent]] $p$ in some place, then $P \iff Q$.
