Implication (implies) of $p\to q$ is only false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. Note that $p\to q \iff \neg p \lor q$[^1].

| $p$ | $q$ | $p\to q$ |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1        |
| 0   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 0        |
| 1   | 1   | 1        |
Note that implication does not imply causality.
