The [[Key|key]] of a *substitution [[Cipher|cipher]]* is a [[Bijective Functions|bijective function]] on a [[Sets|set]]. 
- The [[Ciphertext|ciphertext]] is found by applying the [[Key|key]] to the [[Plaintext|plaintext]].
- The [[Plaintext|plaintext]] is found by applying the [[Inverse Functions|inverse]] of the [[Key|key]] to the [[Cipher|ciphertext]].

These can often be solved using frequency analysis.
