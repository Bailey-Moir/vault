A [[Groups|group]] $(H,*)$ is a *subgroup* of the [[Groups|group]] $(G,*)$ iff $H \subseteq G$.

> [!note] Two-step Test
> For a [[Empty Set|not-empty]] [[Subsets|subset]] $H$ of a [[Groups|group]] $G$, $H$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ iff $H$ is closed under the [[Binary Operations|operation]] and taking inverses.
