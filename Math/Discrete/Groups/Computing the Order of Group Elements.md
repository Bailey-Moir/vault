Let $G$ be a finite [[Groups|group]] of [[Order of a Group and Group Elements|order]] $n$, and $d_{1},\dots,d_{k}$ be the [[Divisibility|divisors]] of $n$. Compute $a^{d_{1}},a^{d_{2}},\dots$. The smallest $d_{i}$ such that $a^{d_{i}} = e$ is the [[Order of a Group and Group Elements|order]] of $a$ in $G$.
