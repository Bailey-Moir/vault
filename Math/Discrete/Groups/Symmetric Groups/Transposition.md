A *transposition* is a [[Cycle Notation|cycle]] of length $2$; an element of $S_{n}$[^1] of [[Order in Groups|order]] $2$.

> [!lemma]- Every [[Permutations|permutation]] in $S_{n}$[^1] can be written as a product of *transpositions*.
> Any $\sigma \in S_{n}$[^1] can be written as a product of [[Cycle Notation|cycles]].
