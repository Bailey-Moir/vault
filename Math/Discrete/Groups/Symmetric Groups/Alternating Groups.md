The number of [[Math/Discrete/Groups/Symmetric Groups/Transposition|transpositions]] in the product of a given [[Cycle Notation|cycle]] is not uniquely determined, but its **parity** is.
- A [[Permutations|permutation]] is **even** if it is a product of an **even** number of [[Math/Discrete/Groups/Symmetric Groups/Transposition|transpositions]].
- A [[Permutations|permutation]] is **odd** if it is a product of an **odd** number of [[Math/Discrete/Groups/Symmetric Groups/Transposition|transpositions]].

The **even** [[Permutations|permutations]] form a [[Subgroups|subgroup]] $A_{n}$ of $S_{n}$[^1] called the *alternating group*.
