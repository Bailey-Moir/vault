In *cycle notation*, each [[Components of Graphs|component]] of the [[Symmetric Groups|symmetric group]] is brackets, with each containing a [[Cycle Notation|cycle]].  

> [!example]
> $$\begin{array}{cccc}
> 	\sigma(1) = 2 &
> 	\sigma(2) = 1 &
> 	\sigma(3) = 6 &
> 	\sigma(4) = 4 &
> 	\sigma(5) = 3 &
> 	\sigma(6) = 5 &
> \end{array}$$
> can be written as
> $$ \sigma = \left( 1 \; 2 \right)\left( 3 \; 6 \; 5 \right), $$
> where $\left( 1\;2 \right)$, $\left( 3\;6\;5 \right)$, and $\left( 4 \right)$ are [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]] [[Walks|cycles]], each an element in $S_{6}$.

> [!lemma] Each [[Permutations|permutation]] in $S_{n}$[^1] can be written as a product/[[Composite Functions|composition]] of [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]] [[Walks|cycles]].
