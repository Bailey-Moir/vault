The *power set* of a [[Sets|set]] $A$ (denoted $\mathcal{P}(A)$) is the collection of all [[Subsets|subsets]] of $A$
$$ \forall A, \mathcal{P}(A) = \left\{ S : S \subseteq A \right\} $$
> [!Theorem]- $\forall A, |\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^{|A|}$
> For each [[Subsets|subset]] of $A$, it can either contain or not contain each element (two options). Since there are $|A|$[^1] elements in $A$, there are then $2^{|A|}$[^1] [[Subsets|subsets]].
