The *cardinality* (or size) of a **finite** [[Sets|set]] $A$ is the number of distinct elements in $A$, denoted $|A|$.

If two **finite** [[Sets|sets]] $A$ and $B$ are [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]]
$$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| $$
If they are **not** [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]]
$$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$
