A [[Functions|function]] is *bijective* (*one-to-one correspondence*) iff it is [[Surjective Functions|surjective]] and [[Injective Functions|injective]];
$$ \forall b \in B, \exists!a \in A : f(a) = b $$
*Note this is the definition of a [[Functions|function]] with $a$ and $b$ swapped*
# Properties of Bijections
Let $f: A \to B$ be a *bijective [[Functions|function]]*:
- $|A| = |B|$[^1]
- $f^{-1} : B \to A$[^2] is *bijective*

[^1]: [[Cardinality]]
[^2]: [[Inverse Functions]]
