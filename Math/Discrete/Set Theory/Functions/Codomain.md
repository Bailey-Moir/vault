A *codomain* (set of destination) of a [[Functions|function]] $f$ is a [[Sets|set]] into which all of the outputs of the [[Functions|function]] must be constrained. 
- If $f \in A \times B$ is a [[Functions|function]], then $B$ is the *co-domain* of $f$ 
- Note this is not necessarily the same as the [[Range|range]].
