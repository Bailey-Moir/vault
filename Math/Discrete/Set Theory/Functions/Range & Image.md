The *range* of a [[Relations|relation]] $\rel \in A \times B$[^1] is the [[Sets|set]]
$$ \left\{ b \in B : \exists a \in A: (a,b) \in \rel \right\} $$

 > [!note] Image
 > The *image* of a [[Functions|function]] is its *range*, and the image of an input is its output (e.g. in $f : A \to B$, the image of $a \in A$ is $f(a) \in B$).
 
> [!note]- Pre-image
> The pre-image of an output is its input[[Injective Functions|(s)]] (e.g. in $f : A \to B$, the pre-image of $b \in b$ is $\{ a \in A : f(a) = b\}$).
