A *[[Partitions|partition]] of an [[Intervals|interval]]* $\left[ a,b \right]$ is a finite [[Sequences|sequence]] of [[The Real Numbers|real numbers]] $x_{0},\dots,x_{n}$ (called **partition points**) such that
$$a=x_{0}\le x_{1} \le \dots \le x_{n} = b,$$
and every [[Intervals|interval]] of the form $\left[ x_{k-1},x_{k} \right]$ is referred to as a **subinterval** of the *partition*.

> [!definition]  We define the [[Norms|norm]] of an *interval partition* $P$ as the width of its widest [[Intervals|interval]]; $$\| P \| = \hspace{-0.2em}\sup_{1\leq k\leq n}\hspace{-0.3em}\left( x_{k}-x_{k-1} \right).$$\[[[Supremums and Infimums]]\]
