If $P$ and $Q$ are [[Interval Partitions|partitions]] of $\left[ a,b \right]$, we say that $Q$ is a *refinement* of $P$, denoted $P\subseteq Q$, iff the [[Interval Partitions|partition points]] of $P$ are a [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Interval Partitions|partition points]] of $Q$.

> [!note] This is equivalent to saying that every [[Intervals|interval]] in $Q$ is [[Subsets|subset]] of an [[Intervals|interval]] in $P$.
