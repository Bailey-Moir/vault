Let $\Z_{n}^\times$ denote the *invertible* elements in $\Z_{n}$[^1];
$$\Z_{n}^\times = \{ a \in \Z_{n} : \text{gcd}(a,n) = 1 \}$$
> [!note] $\left( \Z_{n}^\times, \times \right)$ is an [[Groups|abelian group]] (it is closed under multiplication).

> [!note] $\left| \Z_{n}^\times \right| = \varphi(n)$[^2]

> [!theorem] $(\Z_{m}^\times,\times)$ is [[Cyclic Groups|cyclic]] for $m=1,2,4,p^k,$ or $2p^k$ for an odd [[Primes|prime]] number $p$.
