Let $\Z_{n}^\times$ denote the *invertible* elements in $\Z_{n}$[^1];
$$\Z_{n}^\times = \{ a \in \Z_{n} : \text{gcd}(a,n) = 1 \}$$
> [!note] $\left( \Z_{n}^\times, \times \right)$ is an [[Groups|abelian group]] (it is closed under multiplication).

> [!note] $\left| \Z_{n}^\times \right| = \varphi(n)$[^2]
