$$\forall a,b \in \Z^+, ab = \gcd(a,b)\text{lcm}(a,b)$$
In a very informal sense, the $\gcd(a,b)$ is the [[Unions and Intersections|intersection]] of the primes from $a$ and $b$, and $\text{lcm}(a,b)$ is the [[Unions and Intersections|union]] of the primes from $a$ and $b$.
\[[[Greatest Common Divisor]], [[Lowest Common Multiple]]\]
