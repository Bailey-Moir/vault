The [[Greatest Common Divisor|greatest common divisor]] of two numbers can be written as [[Linear Combinations|linear combinations]] (over the integers) of the two numbers.

## Extended Theorem
$$ \forall a,b,c \in \Z^+, \left( \gcd(a,b)|c \iff \exists x,y \in \Z : ax+by = c\right) $$
For three positive integers, one of the numbers is a [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] (over the integers) of the other two iff that number is a [[Divisibility|multiple]] of the [[Greatest Common Divisor|greatest common divisor]] of the other two.

\[[[Divisibility]]\]
