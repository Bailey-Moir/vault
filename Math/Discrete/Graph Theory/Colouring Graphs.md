[[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|Graphs]] are coloured such that no adjacent [[Vertices|vertices]] are the same colour. A $k$-colouring of a [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] $G$ is a colouring of $G$ that consists of **at most** $k$ colours. The [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] $G$ is $k$-colourable if it has a $k$-colouring.
