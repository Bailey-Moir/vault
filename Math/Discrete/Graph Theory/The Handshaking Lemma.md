For any [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] $G$, the sum of the [[Vertex Degrees|degrees]] of the [[Vertices|vertices]] is twice the number of [[Edges|edges]];
$$\sum_{v \,\in\, V(G)}\delta(v)=2\left| E(G) \right| $$
\[[[Cardinality]]\]

> [!note]- Half an Edge
> Since you can't have half an [[Edges|edge]], the sum of the [[Vertex Degrees|degrees]] must be even.
