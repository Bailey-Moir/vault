Two [[Graphs|graphs]] $G_{1}=\left( V_{1},E_{1} \right)$ and $G_{2}=\left( V_{2},E_{2} \right)$ are *isomorphic* iff there is a [[Bijective Functions|bijection]] $\phi:V_{1}\to V_{2}$ and $\psi:E_{1}\to E_{2}$ such that $e=\{ u,v \}\in E_{1}$ [[Logical Implication|implies]] $\psi(e)=\{ \phi(u),\phi(v) \}$
- This is an [[Equivalence Relations|equivalence relation]].
