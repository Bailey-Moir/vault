A *spanning tree* of a [[Connectivitiy|connected]] [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] is a [[Subgraphs|sub]][[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Definitions/Trees|tree]] formed from the same [[Vertices|vertices]] and a [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Edges|edges]].
- If this is a **minimum *spanning tree***, the [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Edges|edges]] must be chosen such that the [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] has a minimum total [[Weighted Graphs|weight]] (or minimum number of [[Edges|edges]] in an [[Weighted Graphs|unweighted graph]]).
