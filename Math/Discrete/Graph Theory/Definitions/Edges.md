An *edge* is a [[Multi-sets|multi-set]] (or [[Sets|set]] if no [[Loops|loops]] are allowed) containing two [[Vertices|vertices]]. They are said to be **incident** to these two [[Vertices|vertices]], called their **endpoints**.
- A [[Vertices|vertex]] is **adjacent** to another iff they are **incident**
