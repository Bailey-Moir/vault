A *subgraph* of a [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] $G$ is another [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] $H$ formed from a [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Vertices|vertices]] and [[Edges|edges]] of $G$.
- The [[Vertices|vertex]] [[Subsets|subset]] must include all [[Edges|endpoints]] of the [[Edges|edge]] [[Subsets|subset]], but may including additional [[Vertices|vertices]].
  $$\forall e \in E(H), e \subseteq V(H)  $$
