## Edge Deletion
Let $G\setminus e$[^1] denote the [[Graphs|graph]] obtained from $G$ by removing the [[Edges|edge]] $e$.

## Edge Contraction
 Let $G/ e$ denote the [[Graphs|graph]] obtained from $G$ by removing the [[Edges|edge]] $e$ **and combining its end [[Vertices|vertices]]**.

## Vertex Deletion
Let $G\setminus v$[^1] denote the [[Graphs|graph]] obtained from $G$ by removing the [[Vertices|vertex]] $v$.
We say that we have *deleted* $v$ from $G$.
