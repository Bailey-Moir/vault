A *graph* $G$ consists of a [[Vertices|vertex]] [[Sets|set]] $V$ and an [[Edges|edge]] [[Sets|set]] $E$ of 2-element [[Multi-sets|multi-set]] [[Subsets|subsets]] of $V$.
$$ G=\left( V,E \right)  $$
- The [[Edges|edge]] [[Sets|set]] of a *graph* $G$ is denoted $E(G)$.
- The [[Vertices|vertex]] [[Sets|set]] of a *graph* $G$ is denoted $V(G)$.
- If $G$ is a [[Multigraphs|multigraph]] (if [[Parallel Edges|parallel edges]] are permitted), $E(G)$ is actually a [[Multi-sets|multi-set]] not a [[Sets|set]].
