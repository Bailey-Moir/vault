The *degree* of a [[Vertices|vertex]] $v$, (denoted $\delta(v)$ or $d(v)$), is the number of [[Edges|edges]] in its [[Vertex Neighbourhoods|neighbourhood]].
- An **isolated vertex** is a [[Vertices|vertex]] with *degree* zero.
- Each [[Loops|loop]] on a [[Vertices|vertex]] adds $2$ to its *degree*.
