The *neighbourhood* of a [[Vertices|vertex]] $v$ is a [[Subgraphs|subgraph]] formed by all [[Vertices|vertices]] that are [[Edges|adjacent]] to $v$.

> [!definition] For all [[Subsets|subsets]] of [[Vertices|vertices]] of $G$, $X$, let $N(X)$ denote the set of [[Vertex Neighbourhoods|neighbours]] of $X$.
