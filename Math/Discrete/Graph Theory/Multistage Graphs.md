A *multistage graph* is a [[Directed Graphs|directed graph]] where [[Vertices|vertices]] are [[Partitions|partitioned]], such that each [[Vertices|vertex]] only has outgoing edges that go to the next [[Partitions|part]]/*stage*.
$$\forall (u,v) \in E(G), k \in \N, \left(u \in \mathcal{C}_{k} \leftrightarrow v \in \mathcal{C}_{k}\right)$$
