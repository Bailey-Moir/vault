A [[Walks|cycle]] that traverses each [[Vertices|vertex]] of a [[Graphs|graph]] **exactly once** is called a *Hamiltonian cycle*.
A [[Connectivitiy|connected]] [[Graphs|graph]] is *Hamiltonian* if it contains one of these [[Walks|cycles]].
> [!note]- Similarity to [[Eulerian Circuits and Graphs|Eulerian Circuits]]
> This has the same definition as [[Eulerian Circuits and Graphs|Eulerian circuits]], except *Hamiltonian cycles* traverse each **[[Vertices|vertex]]** (not [[Edges|edge]]) exactly once, and thus they are [[Walks|cycles]] not [[Walks|circuits]].
- Let $G$ is a [[Simple Graphs|simple graph]] with $n$ [[Vertices|vertices]], where $n\ge 3$. If the [[Vertex Degrees|degree]] of each [[Vertices|vertex]] is at least $n/2$, $G$ is *Hamiltonian*.
- A [[Walks|cycle]] can not contain any [[Walks|cycles]].
