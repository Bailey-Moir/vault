An *alternating path* of a [[Matchings|matching]] $M$ of $G$ is a [[Walks|path]] in $G$ whose [[Edges|edges]] alternate between being in $M$ and not being in $M$.

> [!theorem] A [[Matchings|matching]] $M$ of $G$ is a [[Matchings|maximum matching]] iff there is no *alternating path* in $G$ that connects [[Matchings|unmatched]] [[Vertices|vertices]].
