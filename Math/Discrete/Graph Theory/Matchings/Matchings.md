A *matching* $M$ of a [[Groups|graph]] $G$ is a [[Sets|set]] of [[Edges|edges]] such that no [[Vertices|vertices]] are shared.

> [!definition] A *matching* $M$ of $G$ is a **maximum matching** iff there is no *matching* that has more [[Edges|edges]] than $M$.

> [!definition] A *matching* $M$ of $G$ is a **maximal matching** iff no [[Edges|edges]] can be added while maintaining $M$ being *matching*.

> [!definition] A *matching* $M$ of $G$ is **perfect** iff every [[Vertices|vertex]] of $G$ is matched by $M$.
