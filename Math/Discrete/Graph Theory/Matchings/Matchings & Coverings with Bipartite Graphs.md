For every [[Matchings|matching]] $M$ and [[Coverings|covering]] $C$ of a [[Bipartite Graphs|bipartite graph]], $M$ is [[Maximal vs. Maximum|maximum]] and $C$ is [[Maximal vs. Maximum|minimal]] iff
$$\left| M \right| = \left| C \right| $$

> [!theorem]- In a general [[Graphs|graph]], only the [[Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive|converse]] holds
> This is a corollary of a theorem in \[[[Coverings]]\]
