A *bipartite graph* is a [[Simple Graphs|simple graph]] whose [[Vertices|vertex set]] can be [[Partitions|partitioned]] into two [[Empty Set|non-empty sets]] such that all [[Edges|edges]] connect a [[Vertices|vertex]] in one part to a [[Vertices|vertex]] in the other part.
- A *bipartite graph* is said to be a **[[Complete Graphs|complete]] bipartite [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]]** if every [[Vertices|vertex]] is [[Connectivitiy|connected]] to every [[Vertices|vertex]] in the other part. If the [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of the parts are $m$ and $n$, the [[Math/Discrete/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] is denoted $K_{m,n}$. Note that a [[Complete Graphs|complete graph]] can not be *bipartite*.
