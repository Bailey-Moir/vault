Given two [[Math/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Vectors|vectors]] that describe side lengths of a triangle, the area can be calculated as half of the [[Area of Parallelograms|area of the parallelogram]] formed by the two [[Math/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Vectors|vectors]].
$$A=\dfrac{1}{2}\| \vecbf{x}\times \vecbf{y} \|$$
\[[[Area of Parallelograms]]\]
