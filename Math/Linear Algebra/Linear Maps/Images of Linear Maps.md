If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, then $\text{im}\,T$[^3] is a [[Subspaces|subspace]] of $W$.
  > [!proof]-
> Note that by the definition of a [[Linear Maps|linear map]]/[[Functions|function]], the [[Range & Image|range]] must be a [[Subsets|subset]] of $W$.
> 
> **Additive Identity**
> Since $T\,\vecbf{0} = \vecbf{0}$, $\vecbf{0}$ must be in the [[Range & Image|range]].
> 
> **Closed Under Addition and Scalar Multiplication**
> By the definition of a [[Linear Maps|linear map]], it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

> [!note] $\text{dim}\,\text{im}\,T = \text{rank}\,T$[^1][^2]

> [!note] $\text{im}\,T =\text{col}\,\mathcal{M}(T)$[^4][^5]
