A [[Linear Systems|linear system]] where all of the constants on the RHS are $0$; $A\vecbf{x} = \vecbf{0}$
- In these systems, there will always be at least one solution: the **trivial solution** $\vecbf{x} = \vecbf{0}$, thus,
- *Homogeneous systems* are **always consistent**.
- If $A$ is [[Singular Matrices|singular]], there are infinite solutions for $\vecbf{x}$.
