Once a [[Matrices|matrix]] is in [[EF & REF|REF]], the first non-zero element of each row is called a *pivot*, and the corresponding variable a *pivot variable*, while others are variables are called *free variables*.
![200|center](pivots-and-free-variables.excalidraw)
If all variables are *pivot variables* (no *free variables*), there will be a unique solution, otherwise there will be infinitely many solutions (unless the system is [[Consistency of Linear Systems|inconsistent]]).

> [!note]  $\text{rank}\,A$[^1] is given by the number of *pivots variables*, $\text{nullity}\,A$[^2] is given by the number of *free variables*.

[^1]: [[Rank]]
[^2]: [[Nullity]]
