The [[Vector Spaces|vector spaces]] over the same [[Fields|field]]  are *multiplied* using the [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian product]].

> [!theorem] If $V_{1},\dots,V_n$ are [[Vector Spaces|vector spaces]] over $\F$, then $V_{1}\times \dots \times V_{n}$ is a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] over $\F$.

why not have the product be the basis together? I think cause it would have to only be for direct sums.
