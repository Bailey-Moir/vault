| Term                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| General Solution / Solution Set | Set of all solutions. I let this be $S$.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Consistent                      | Describes a system that has at least one solution; $\left\lvert S\right\rvert \ge 1$                                                                                                                                                         |
| Inconsistent                    | Describes a system that has no solutions; $\left\lvert S \right\rvert = 0$                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Homogeneous                     | A system of linear equations with all non-zero coefficients, and where all equations are 0. These are always consistent.                                                                                                                     |
| Echelon Form (EF)               | A system of linear equations where the first variable in each equation does not appear in the equations below. <br/> In this form, the first variable in each equation is called the pivot variable, while others are called free variables. |
| Row Echelon Form (REF)          | A matrix in REF corresponds to a system of linear equations in EF.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Pivot                           | A pivot is the first non-zero element of any given row of a matrix in REF, and the corresponding variable is a pivot variable.                                                                                                               |
| Free Variables                  | A free variable is a variable that is not a pivot. <br/> For example,  $y$ is free in <br/> $\begin{matrix}x &+& -3y &&  & = & 1 \\  &&  && z & = & -1\end{matrix}$.                                                                         |
