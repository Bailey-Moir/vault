A system where all of the constants on the RHS are 0; $A\vecbf{x} = \vecbf{0}$
- In these systems, there will always be **at least one solution: the trivial solution** at $\vecbf{x} = \vecbf{0}$.
- *Homogeneous systems* are **always consistent**.
- If $A$ is [[Singular Matrices|singular]], there are infinite solutions for $\vecbf{x}$.
