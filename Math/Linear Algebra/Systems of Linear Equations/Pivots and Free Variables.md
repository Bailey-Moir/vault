Once in [[EF & REF|REF]], the first non-zero element of each row is called a pivot, and the corresponding variable a pivot variable, while others are variables are called free variables.
![200|center](pivots-and-free-variables.excalidraw)

- If all variables are pivot variables (no free variables), there will be a unique solution.
- If there are more variables than pivots, there will be infinitely many solutions. <br>This implies that there will be infinitely many solutions if there are less meaningful equations than there are variables (if $m < n$ assuming no zero rows). 

The above statements have the exception of [[Inconsistent Systems in REF|the system being inconsistent]].
