$$\large \exists 0 \in V \ni \forall v \in V, \left( v + 0 = v \right)$$
> [!proof]- Proof Additive Identity is Unique
> Suppose $0$ and $0'$ are both additive identities. It is then true that:
> $$\begin{align*}
>	0' &= 0' + 0 \\
>	&= 0 + 0' && (1) \text{ Commutativity} \\
>	&= 0
> \end{align*}$$
> Thus $0' = 0$, proving $V$ has only one additive identity.
