A [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] is called a *finite-dimensional* iff some [[Lists|list]] of vectors in it [[Span|spans]] the space.
$$ \exists \vecbf{v}_1, \dots, \vecbf{v}_m \in V : \text{span}(\vecbf{v}_1 + \dots + \vecbf{v}_m) = V $$
- In any *finite dimensional vector space*, the length of any [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] [[Lists|list]] of vectors is less than or equal to the length of any [[Span|spanning]] [[Lists|list]] of vectors.
