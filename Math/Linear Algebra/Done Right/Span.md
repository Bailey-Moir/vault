The set of all [[Linear Combinations|linear combinations]] of a [[Lists|list]] of vectors $v_1, \dots, v_m$ in [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] $V$ is called the *span* of $v_1, \dots, v_m$, denoted by $\text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_m)$. In other words,
$$ \text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_m) = \left\{ a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m : a_1,\dots, a_m \in \F \right\} $$
- The span of a [[Lists|list]] of vectors in [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] $V$ is the smallest [[Subspaces|subspace]] of $V$ containing all vectors in the [[Lists|list]]. 
	This is similar to how the [[Sums of Subspaces|sum of subspaces]] of $V$ is the smallest [[Subspaces|subspace]] of $V$ containing each of the summed [[Subspaces|subspaces]].
- If $\text{span}(v_1,\dots,v_m) = V$, we say that "the list  $v_1,\dots,v_m$ spans $V$"
