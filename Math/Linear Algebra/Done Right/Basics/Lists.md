*Lists* are often written as elements separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses. Thus a *list* of length two is an ordered pair that might be written as $(a,b)$. A *list* of length $n$ (called an **$\bf{n}$-tuple**) might look like $\left( z_1, \dots, z_n \right)$. Note *lists* always have a non-negative finite length. *Lists* differ from sets in that they are **ordered**, allowing for **repetition**.

$\F^n$ is the set of all *lists* of length $n$ with elements of $\F$[^1]:
$$ \F^n = \left\{ \left(x_1, \dots, x_n \right) : x_k \in \F \text{ for } k = 1, \dots,  n \right\} $$

> [!note] $0$ list
> Let $0$ denote the *list* of length $n$ whose coordinates are all $0$ (similar in concept to [[Zero Matrices|zero matrices]]).
> $$ 0 = \left( 0, \dots, 0 \right) $$
