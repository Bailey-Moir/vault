A subset $U$ of a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] $V$ is called a *subspace* of $V$ iff $U$ is also a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] with the same [[Additive Identity of Vector Spaces|additive identity]], addition, and scalar multiplication as on 𝑉. 

**Additive Identity** - $0 \in U$
**Closed Under Addition** - $\forall u,v \in U, \left( u + v \in U \right)$
**Closed Under Scalar Multiplication** - $\forall u \in U, \lambda \in \F, \left( \lambda u \in U \right)$

> [!note]
> Note that for the *subspace* to be closed under scalar multiplication, the scalar [[Fields|field]] $\F$ is inherited from the parent [[Vector Spaces|vector space]].

- Every [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] $V$ has the *subspaces* $\{0\}$ and $V$ (which may be the same).
