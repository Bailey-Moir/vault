A *vector space* is a **set** $V$ along with a **closed** addition on $V$ and a **closed** scalar multiplication on $V$ with:
- [[Commutativity of Vector Spaces|commutativity]]
- [[Associativity of Vector Spaces|associativity]]
- [[Additive Identity of Vector Spaces|additive identity]]
- [[Additive Inverse of Vector Spaces|additive inverse]]
- [[Multiplicative Identity of Vector Spaces|multiplicative identity]]
- [[Distributive Property of Vector Spaces|distributive property]].

> - The elements of a *vector space* are called vectors or points.
> - A *vector space* over $A$ is a *vector space* with $A$ as the scalar [[Fields|field]].
> - A *vector space* over $\R$ is called a **real vector space**.
> - A *vector space* over $\C$ is called a **complex vector space**.
