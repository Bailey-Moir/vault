A *basis* of $V$ is a [[Span|spanning list]] of $V$ that is [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]].

> $B_1$ is [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] and $B_2$ is a [[Span|spanning list]], so $B_1$ is at most the same size as $B_2$[^1]. Reversing the roles gives that they are the same size.
