*Orthogonal diagonalisation* is the same as normal [[Diagonalisation|diagonalisation]], except the columns of $P$ (now $Q$, the [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvectors]]) must be chosen to be [[Orthogonal Vectors|orthonormal]]. Then, $Q$ is [[Orthogonal Matrices|orthogonal]], and
$$A = QDQ^T$$

> [!theorem]- $A \in \R^{n,n}$ is *orthogonally diagonalisable* iff there is an [[Orthogonal Vectors|orthonormal]] [[Basis|basis]] of $\R^n$ consisting of [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of $A$.

> [!theorem]- $A\in \R^{n,n}$ is *orthogonally diagonalisable* $A$ has $n$ [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of $A$ **and** the [[Eigenspaces|eigenspaces]] of $A$ are mutually [[Orthogonal Complements|orthogonal]].
