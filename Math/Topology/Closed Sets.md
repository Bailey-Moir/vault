A [[Subsets|subset]] $A \subseteq X$ of a [[Topology|topological space]] $\left( X,\mathcal{T} \right)$ is a *closed set* iff its [[Complement|complement]] is [[Open Sets|open]] ($A^c \in \mathcal{T}$).

The axioms of a [[Topology|topology]]/[[Open Sets|open set]] can be restated in terms of *closed sets* as so:
1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are *closed*,
2. *closed sets* are closed under finite [[Unions & Intersections|unions]], and
3. they are closed under arbitrary [[Unions & Intersections|intersections]].
