A *neighbourhood* of a point $p$ in a [[Topology|topological space]] $\left( X,\mathcal{T} \right)$ is an [[Open Sets|open set]] that contains $p$.

> [!notation] For these notes, I will use $\mathcal{N}_{p}$ to denote the set of *neighbourhoods* of $p$: $$\mathcal{N}_{p} := \{ A \in \mathcal{T} : p \in A \}$$
