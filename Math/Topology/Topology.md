A *topology* $\mathcal{T}$ of a [[Sets|set]] $X$ is a [[Collections|collection]] of [[Subsets|subsets]] of $X$ such that
1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$,
2. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite [[Unions & Intersections|intersections]], and
3. $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary [[Unions & Intersections|unions]].

> [!definition] The pair $\left( X,\mathcal{T} \right)$ is called a **topological space**.
