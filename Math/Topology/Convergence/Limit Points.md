A point $p \in X$ is a *limit point* of $S \subseteq X$ iff every [[Neighbourhoods|neighbourhood]] of $p$ contains a point of $S$ other than $p$ itself; iff
$$ \forall A \in \mathcal{N}_{p}, S \cap A \not\subseteq \{ p \} $$
> [!definition]- *([[Sequences|Sequence]] Limit Points)* A point $p \in X$ is a *limit point* of an infinite [[Sequences|sequence]] $\left( a_{n} \right)$ iff some subsequence of $\left( a_{n} \right)$ [[Sequence Convergence|converges]] to $p$.
