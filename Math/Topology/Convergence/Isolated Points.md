An *isolated point* of $S \subseteq X$ is a point $p \in S$ that has a [[Neighbourhoods|neighbourhood]] $A$ such that $S \cap A = \{ p \}$;
$$p \in S \land \exists A \in \mathcal{N}_{p} : S \cap A = \{ p \}$$

> [!note] This is the [[Negation|negation]] of the definition of a [[Limit Points|limit point]] if you assume $p \in S$ (i.e. a point $p \in S$ is a [[Limit Points|limit point]] iff it is not *isolated*).
