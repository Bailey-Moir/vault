*Elliptic Paraboloid* are the $\R^3$ [[Quadric Surfaces|quadric surfaces]] that are equivalent to [[Parabolas|parabolas]] in [[Conic Sections|conic sections]].

$$ z =  \dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{b^2}$$
- Note the formula for an [[Elliptic Cone|elliptic cone]] is the same as a formula for an *elliptic paraboloid* but with the $\text{LHS}$ ($z$) squared.

\[[[Parabolas]]\]
