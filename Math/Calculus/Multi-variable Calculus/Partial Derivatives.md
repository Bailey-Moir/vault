$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
	f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0}) & 
	\text{or} &
	\left.\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{\left( x_{0},y_{0} \right)} 
\end{array}$$
$f_{x}$ is found by treating the other variable as constant and differentiating $f$ wrt. $x$.
- $f_{xy} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right)$
- $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$ (if [[Definition of Continuity|continuous]])
