Let $f(x,y)$ be a [[Functions|function]] with [[Continuity|continuous]] second-order [[Partial Derivatives|partial derivatives]] near the [[Critical Points of Surfaces|critical point]] $(x_0,y_0)$. Let $D$ be a [[Functions|function]] defined by
$$D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - \left(f_{xy}\right)^2$$
Then at $(x_0,y_0)$,
- if $D>0$ and $f_{xx}<0$, the point is a relative maximum.
- if $D>0$ and $f_{xx}>0$, the point is a relative minimum.
- if $D<0$, it is a saddle point.
- if $D=0$, the test is inconclusive.
