A local extreme (maximum or minimum) is a point on that is the smallest or largest in its neighborhood.
$$
\begin{array}{c}
	\textbf{local maximum} \text{ at } c \impliedby \forall x \text{ near c}, f(c) \ge f(x)\\
	\textbf{local minimum} \text{ at } c \impliedby \forall x \text{ near c}, f(c) \le f(x)\\
\end{array}
$$
It should be noted that all local extrema are [[Critical Points|critical points]].
