 Let $f$ and $g$ be [[Functions|functions]], $c \in \R$, and $a \in\text{dom}\,f \cap\text{dom}\,g$. If $f$ and $g$ are [[Differentiation|differentiable]] at $a$,
 - then $cf$ is [[Differentiation|differentiable]] at, and
   $$\left( cf \right)'(a) = cf'(a),$$
- and $f+g$ is [[Differentiation|differentiable]] at $a$, and
  $$\left( f+g \right)'(a) = f'(a) + g'(a).$$
