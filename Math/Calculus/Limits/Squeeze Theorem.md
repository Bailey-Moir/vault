If $f(x) \le g(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ (except possibly at $a$) and the limits of both at $a$ are convergent, then
$$ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) \le \lim_{x\to a} h(x) $$

If $f(x) \le g(x) \le h(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ except possibly at $a$, and $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a} h(x) = L$, then $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = L$.
