Rolle's Theorem is a specific example of the [[Intermediate Value Theorem|mean value theorem]], where $f(a) = f(b)$, meaning $f'(c) = 0$.

> [!proof]-
> If the maximum and minimum occur at the end points, since $f(a) = f(b)$ , $f(c)$ is constant so $f'(c) = 0$ for all $c \in (a,b)$.
> 
> Otherwise, either the maximum or the minimum aren't at the end points, meaning a [[Local Extrema|local extrema]] occurs at some $c \in (a,b)$, on which $f$ is [[Differentiation|differentiable]], so $f'(c) = 0$[^1]
