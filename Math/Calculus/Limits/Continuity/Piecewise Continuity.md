A [[Functions|function]] $f$ is *piecewise continuous* iff its [[Domain|domain]] can [[Interval Partitions|partitioned]] into finitely many [[Intervals|intervals]], such that is $f$ [[Continuity|continuous]] on each [[Partitions|part]]/[[Intervals|interval]].

> [!note] The end points of these [[Intervals|intervals]] must [[Metric Sequence Convergence|converge]] on either side (both not necessarily together)
