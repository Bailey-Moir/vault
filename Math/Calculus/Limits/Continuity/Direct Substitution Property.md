If $f$ is [[Algebraic and Transcendental Functions|algebraic]], [[Types of Functions|trigonometric]], [[Exponential Functions|exponential]], or [[Logarithmic Functions|logarithmic]], then $f$ is [[Math/Calculus/Limits/Continuity/Continuity|continuous]] on its domain, meaning for all $a$ in the [[Domain|domain]] $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)$ (due to the [[Math/Calculus/Limits/Continuity/Continuity|definition of continuity]]).
