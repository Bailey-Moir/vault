A [[Solutions of Linear Systems|system]] is *hyperbolic* if all [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvalues]] have non-zero [[The Real Numbers|real]] components. There are three types of *hyperbolic systems*:
1. [[Stable and Unstable Nodes|Stable origin]],
2. [[Stable and Unstable Nodes|Unstable origin]], and
3. **Hyperbolic saddles** (where some are positive and others are negative).
