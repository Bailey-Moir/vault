The origin is a *stable node* (or *attractor*) iff all [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvalues]] have a **negative** [[The Real Numbers|real]] component, as they converge exponentially to $0$.

The origin is an *unstable node* (or *repellor*) iff all [[Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues|eigenvalues]] have a **positive** [[The Real Numbers|real]] component, as they converge exponentially to $0$.

> [!note] If the imaginary component is non-zero, the origin is referred to as a **spiral** instead of a **node** (e.g. *stable spiral*) .
