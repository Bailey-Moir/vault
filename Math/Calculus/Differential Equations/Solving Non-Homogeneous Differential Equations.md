The [[General vs Particular Solution|general solution]] to the [[Homogeneous Differential Equations|non-homogeneous]] problem
$$y'' + py' + qy + r(x),\hspace{2em}r(x)\ne0$$
always has a special structure that can be written as
$$y(x) = y_p(x) + y_h(x)$$
- The **particular solution**, $y_p$, is a [[General vs Particular Solution|particular solution]] (not [[General vs Particular Solution|general]] – no arbitrary constants) to the DE with RHS $r(x)$
$$y_p'' + py_p' + qy_p = r(x)$$
• The **homogeneous solution**/complementary solution, $y_h$, contains all the constants of integration and is the [[General vs Particular Solution|general solution]] to the [[Homogeneous Differential Equations|homogeneous]] version of the DE
$$y_h'' + py_h' + qy_h = 0$$
The **particular solution** is found with  [[Method of Undetermined Coefficients|the method of undetermined coefficients]], and the **homogeneous solution** is found using the corresponding [[Auxiliary Equations|auxiliary equation]].
