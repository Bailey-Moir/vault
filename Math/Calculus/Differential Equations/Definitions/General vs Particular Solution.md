> **General Solution**
> The general solution of an [[Order|n-th order]] DE is a family of functions containing $n$ arbitrary constants / constants of integraiton that satisfy the DE.

> **Particular Solution**
> A non-general solution (no constants of integration). If the graph of this solution is drawn in the $xy$-plane, it is called an **integral curve**.
