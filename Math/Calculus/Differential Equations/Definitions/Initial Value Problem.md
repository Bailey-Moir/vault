*Initial Value Problems* (*IVPs*) are problems where you need to find a [[General vs Particular Solution|particular solution]] when given **initial conditions** of the form $y^{(i)}(t_{0}) = k$ for some $k$.

> [!note] An $n$-th [[Order|order]] [[Differential Equations|DE]] requires $n$ **initial conditions** to find a [[General vs Particular Solution|particular solution]].
