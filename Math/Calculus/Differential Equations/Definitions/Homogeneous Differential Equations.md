In a *homogeneous* differential equation, all terms are dependent on the dependent variable (all terms contain $y$). This is normally thought of as the RHS being 0. For example the following is a *homogeneous* [[Order|2nd order]] [[Linear Differential Equations|linear]] DE:
$$w(x)\dfrac{d^2y}{{dx}^2} + p(x)\dfrac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = 0$$
Any [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of solutions to a *homogeneous* DE is also a solution.
