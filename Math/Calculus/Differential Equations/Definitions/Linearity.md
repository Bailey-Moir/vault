A DE is *linear* if the dependent variable ($y$) and it's derivatives ($\frac{dy}{dx}$, $\frac{d^2y}{{dx}^2}$, $\dots$) only occur to the first power, and coefficients of the dependent variable and its derivatives only involve constants or functions of the independent variable ($x$). That is, any *linear differential equation* can be written in the following form
$$ a_n(x)\dfrac{d^ny}{{dx}^n} a_{n-1}(x)\dfrac{d^{n-1}y}{{dx}^{n-1}} + \dots + a_1(x) \dfrac{d^1y}{{dx}^1} + a_0(x)y = F(x)$$
where $a_n(x)$, $a_{n-1}(x)$, $\dots$, $a_1(x)$, $a_0(x)$ and $F(x)$ depend only on the independent variable $x$.
