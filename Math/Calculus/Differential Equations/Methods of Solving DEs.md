There are 3 approaches to solving [[Differential Equations|DEs]]:
1. **Analytical Methods**
   Finding [[Functions|functions]](s) that satisfy the [[Differential Equations|DE]] (often not possible).
2. **Geometric Methods**
   By analysing the sign of the derivatives, we are able to infer things about the solution such as [[Critical Points|critical points]] and [[Asymptotes|asymtotes]].
3. **Numerical Methods**
   Simplify into easier problems, introducing error that should be quantified.
