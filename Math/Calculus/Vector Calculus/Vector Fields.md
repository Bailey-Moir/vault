A *vector field* is a [[Functions|function]] that maps every point in space (a [[Vectors|vector]]) to another [[Vectors|vector]].

> [!note] A *vector field* is the same as a [[Scalar Fields|scalar field]], except instead of assigning a number to every point, *vector fields* assign a [[Math/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Vectors|vector]] to every point.
