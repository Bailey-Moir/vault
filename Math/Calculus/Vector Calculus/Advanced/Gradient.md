The *gradient* of a [[Scalar Fields|scalar field]] can be defined using the [[Nabla Operator|nabla operator]]:
$$ \text{grad}\,f = \nabla f = \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\vecu{e}_1 + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\vecu{e}_2$$
\[[[Vector Basis]]\]

- The gradient always points in direction of greatest increase of $f$.
- The gradient has a magnitude equal to the maximum rate of change at the point.

Is this true?
- $\nabla f$ is perpendicular to [[Level Set|level sets]].
