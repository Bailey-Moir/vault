A scalar field is a [[Functions|function]] associating a scalar with every point in space.
- A simple function like $f(x) = \sin x$ is a scalar field in 1 space ($\R^1$). These are often represented as simple 2D graphs.

- A function like $f(x,y) = \sin \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is a scalar field in 2 space ($\R^2$). These can be represented by 3D graphs or [contour maps](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nusniq2lqx).
