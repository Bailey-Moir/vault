The integral of a rate of change is the net change. This can easily be proven by [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC1]] and the definition of an antiderivative.
$$\begin{array}{c}
\displaystyle\int_a^b F'(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) \\
\displaystyle\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left| v(t) \right| \, dt = \text{total distance travelled} \\
\end{array}$$
