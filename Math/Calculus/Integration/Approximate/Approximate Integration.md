Most students are taught integration as finding an anti-derivative and using [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC2]]. In the real world, most integration is done using data.

The most basic method for this is [[Riemann Sums]], but there are more accurate estimations such as the [[Midpoint Rule|midpoint rule]], the [[Trapezium Rule|trapezium rule]], and [[Simpson's Rule|Simpson's rule]]. These have varying levels of error, defined by their [[Error Bounds|error bounds]].
