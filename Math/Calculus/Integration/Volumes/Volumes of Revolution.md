As can be seen, if the function is being rotated about the axis that it is bounded by, then [[Volumes by Disks]] is typically used, whereas if they are opposite, then [[Volumes by Cylindrical Shells]] is typically used. However, it should be noted that for a given problem, both methods can normally be used, it's just an issue of practicality.
