There are three types of *minor scales*: **harmonic**, **melodic**, and the mostly unused **natural**. All of these are identified by the accidentals throughout the piece.
- **Harmonic minor scales** are the same as their [[Relative Majors & Minors|relative major]] but with a raised $7$th.

- **Melodic minor scales** are the same as their [[Relative Majors & Minors|relative major]], with a raised $6$th and $7$th when ascending (not raised when descending).
![1000](melodic-scale.excalidraw.md)
- **Natural minor scales** are exactly the same as their [[Relative Majors & Minors|relative major]].
