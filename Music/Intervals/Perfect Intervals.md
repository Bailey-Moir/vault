[[Music/Intervals/Intervals|Intervals]] over four letter notes (e.g. $\text{C}$ to $\text{F}$), five letter notes (e.g. $\text{C}$ to $\text{G}$), and eight letter notes (e.g. $\text{C}$ to $\text{C}$) are *perfect intervals*.

> [!note] Joining a *perfect fifth* with a *perfect fourth* makes an [[Octaves|octave]] (a *perfect eighth*).
