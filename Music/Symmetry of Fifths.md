Incrementing the [[Tonic|tonic]] by a [[Perfect Intervals|perfect fifth]] adds a sharp / removes a flat from the [[Key Signatures|key signature]], while incrementing the tonic by a [[Perfect Intervals|perfect fourth]] (equivalent to decrementing it by a [[Perfect Intervals|perfect fifth]]) removes a sharp / adds a flat from the [[Key Signatures|key signature]].

> [!proof]- Incrementing the [[Tonic|tonic]] by a [[Perfect Intervals|perfect fifth]] results in the same [[Key Signatures|key signature]], but with the resulting $\text{7th}$ sharpened.

> [!proof]- Incrementing the [[Tonic|tonic]] by a [[Perfect Intervals|perfect fourth]] results in the same [[Key Signatures|key signature]], but with the original $\text{7th}$ (or resulting $\text{4th}$) flattened.

> [!note]  The [[Tonic|tonic]] is a note above the last sharp of the [[Key Signatures|key signature]].
