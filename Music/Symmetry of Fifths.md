In a given key, the key with a tonic of the fifth note has one more sharp / one less flat. Conversely, the key with a tonic of the fourth note (a fifth below) has one more flat / one less sharp.

The key of the fifth has the same [[Key Signatures|key signature]], but with the fourth (or fifth's seventh) sharpened.

Thus, the last sharp in a [[Key Signatures|key signature]] is always the seventh. This means looking at a [[Key Signatures|key signature]], the tonic is a note above the last sharp.

Conversely, the key of the fourth (negative fifth) has the same [[Key Signatures|key signature]], but with the seventh (or fourth's fourth) flattened.
